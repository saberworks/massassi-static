    A re-texture of the Moldy Crow 3DO turning it into a 90s era Stock Car, with racing colours, sponsor logos and the number 41. This model is an homage to the car seen in the DAYTONA USA Arcade Game from 1994.

    This model was made purely for fun and despite the implication of the screenshots, was NOT created for a larger mod or level set.
