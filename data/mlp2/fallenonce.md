    First came the wind, then the storm, and then the dam broke down. Water started
    to flood block after block in the city of Solonia. Reacting quickly, the mayor
    had the blocks blocked off before the water got to the more important sections
    of the city... Unfortunately, a handful of warriors were trapped. Now they have
    only their weapons to survive..
