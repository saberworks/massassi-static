    A somewhat small research facility, located many fathoms below the surface, and
    surrounded by a pressure shield. Includes an airlock for escaping into the
    frigid waters, an airtank to ensure you survive the trip, a call switch in the
    control room to drop depth charges, and many other surprises.
