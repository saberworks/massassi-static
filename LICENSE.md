# Background

This repo contains a bunch of content that was freely submitted to The Massassi 
Temple by hundreds of people over multiple decades.  Many downloadable files 
(such as levels/maps/mods) have their own embedded license file included in the 
zip file.  Things like tutorials or other editing information was submitted to 
the site for publishing.  As far as I know there was no restriction on 
redistributing the content.

It is my intention to make all the files open source but I do not have the 
authority to do this for everything in this repo.  If in doubt, please try to 
contact the individual author.

For all Python files in this repo that were written by me (Brian E. Lozier) the
