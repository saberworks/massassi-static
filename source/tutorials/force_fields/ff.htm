You'll need a gob extractor for this one.  I suggest conman available from 
<a href="http://www.darkjedi.com/" target="_top">www.darkjedi.com</a>
in the file section. Yes, there are some forcefield cogs
that don't require extraction, but they're not worth anyone's time.
<BR><BR>
1) Extract <i>10_ffieldswitch.cog</i> from jk1.gob in the Jediknight\episode 
directory. There are a few others you can use too, but in my opinion, 10_ffieldswitch is 
the best...It allows textures to be displayed when hit (other forcefields
can only handle a solid color .mat) and the switch can be activated by 
gunfire as well as regular activation with the spacebar.  There are others
you can use, experiment if you like, they all work the same (some may require
a little different info then others, but nothing confusing once you figure 
out 10_ffieldswitch) 00forcefield.cog doesn't have a switch, so you probably 
won't want that one..
<BR><BR>
2) Put it in your project directory. If you don't have one, make one.
The project directory, in case you don't know, is simply where your .jed 
and .~je files are.
<BR><BR>
3) Open up JED and extrude one side of the default sector (this will make
the adjoin that the force field will be applied to)
<BR><BR>
4) Note the numbers of both surfaces that make up the adjoin.
<BR><BR>
5) Now to make the switch.. Just cleave a little 0.1x0.1 square on another
wall. Oh, and in a level that you're going to release, all you switches should
be indented into the wall a little. (don't take the time to do it right now,
this level will never be released to the public.. at least I hope not) It 
doesn't impact the game, but a switch on a flat wall just looks like it was 
painted on. Note the number of the surface that will act as your switch.
<BR><BR>
6) Ok, if you made a project directory for this, you'll have to save the .jed
before you proceed. (otherwise, JED won't recognize that you have a project
directory, and you won't be able to choose 10_ffieldswitch.cog from "Placed 
Cogs") Go to the "tools" menu and click on "Placed Cogs," then go to "Add Cog,"
and then "Project Directory".. 
Select <i>10_ffieldswitch.cog</i>.  It will ask for the following values..
<BR><BR>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" width="60%">
<tr><td width="35%">switch (surface)</td><td>
	This is simply the surface acting as your switch. Sector first then 
surface.. A switch on sector 0, surface 3 would look like 0 3 (note the space 
in between them) in "Placed Cogs"</td></tr>
<tr><td>damsurf (surface)<br>
damsurf2 (surface)</td><td>These are the surfaces that make up the adjoin. Enter the numbers
the same way you entered them for the switch surface.</td></tr>
<tr><td>maxdamage<br>
mindamage</td><td>These are the maximum and minimum amounts of damage a player can take
by hitting the forcefield. The actual amount of damage is a random number 
between the mindamage and maxdamage.</td></tr>
</table>
<BR><BR>
7) Textures. Well, if you're using 10_ffieldswitch, you can use any texture your heart
desires, as long as it's not a single color mat.. As near as I can tell, 
10_ffieldswitch will not support solid color mats.. However, most textures 
look ridiculously stupid as a forcefield. A safe bet would be 00wwarny or 
00wwarnr. They're caution textures (like that yellow and black striped tape 
they put up near construction sites) Just make sure that both sides of the 
adjoin have the same texture.
<BR><BR>
8) Save and test. If you've done everything correctly, you've got yourself
a nice little forcefield.. Hooray!
