<br>

<p>Before you try making a pong level, you should have a decent
amount experience with jed- you should know how to add templates,
place cogs, set frames for objects, and the like.</p>

<p><b><a href="neededfiles.zip">Download this first!</a></b><br>
This contains all the files necessary to make a pong level: the
COG files, the new templates, etc.</p>

<p>Note that even if you have the original &quot;For Authors.zip&quot; you should download this, because the cogs have been updated and are now much easier to work with.</p>

<h3>1. Structural requirements for a pong level:</h3>

<ul>
    <li><p><b>A lobby:</b> where players
        will first spawn.<br>
        <img src="1.jpg" width="459" height="247"></p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
    <li><p><b>2 team entrances:</b> 1 red,
        1 gold. Best way I've found is doorway leading to a
        vertical shaft, which is cleaved into 3 sectors
        horizontally (so there are 3 sectors stacked on top of
        one another)<br>
        <img src="2.jpg" width="442" height="290"><img
        src="2B.jpg" width="545" height="324"></p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
    <li><p><b>2 control rooms:</b> 1 red, 1 gold. These
        must be split up in a certain way. In front of the
        viewing window through which you watch the action, there
        must be three sectors lined up in a row. There also must
        be a button used for &quot;serving&quot; the ball, and a
        cancel switch. It's best if each of these control rooms
        has exactly 8 sectors- if they don't you'll have to do a
        little bit of cog editing- don't worry, I'll lead you
        through that later on.<br>
        <img src="3.jpg" width="486" height="242"></p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
    <li><p><b>An arena:</b> at either end there must be a
        sector which will be designated as the goal. <br>
        <img src="4.jpg" width="486" height="242"></p>
    </li>
    <li><p><b>4 scoring surfaces:</b> 2 red, 2 gold.<br>
        <img src="4B.jpg" width="199" height="93"> <img
        src="4B.jpg" width="199" height="93"></p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>2. Item requirements for a pong level:</h3>

<p>Once you have your level built the way you want
it, you should start adding the items. Here is how you'll need
the items set up.</p>

<ul>
    <li><p><b>24 walkplayer things:</b>
        the first 8 will be the locations the red player will
        respawn if he dies, which should go in the red control
        center. The next 8 will be where the gold player
        respawns- these should be placed in the gold control
        center. The final 8 will be where the players who are in
        the lobby respawn. They should, of course, be placed in
        the lobby.<strong><br>
        <img src="5.jpg" width="463" height="357"></strong></p>
    </li>
    <li><p><b>2 paddles:</b> 1 for the red
        player, 1 for the gold. Each of these paddles should have
        2 frames- the 1st at the furthest position to the left
        that the paddle will reach, to 2nd to the furthest
        position on the right of the paddle.<br>
        <img src="6.jpg" width="536" height="358"></p>
    </li>
    <li><p><b>4 ghosts:</b> 2 for the
        places the ball starts, 2 to make sure the player can
        safely enter the level. The first ghosts should be placed
        at the locations that you want the pong balls to appear
        when the players serve- 1 for gold, 1 for red. Make sure
        you have them pointed in the direction you want the ball
        to go as well. The second 2 ghosts should be placed at
        the tops of the entrance shafts.<br>
        <img src="6B.jpg" width="451" height="227"><br>
        <img src="7.jpg" width="457" height="288"></p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>3. Setting up PONG_MAIN:</h3>

<p>Now that you have all the sectors, surfaces and
things set up correctly, it's time to start assigning these
values in the actual pong game.</p>

<p>For this part, you need to get the Pong cogs.
These are available in the zip at the top of the tutorial-
they've been cleaned up a bit from the ones in the original
release, so they're easier to set up. Stick those cogs into your
project directory and then, using the &quot;Placed cogs&quot;
window in JED (F7) place those cogs into the level. Now, select
the first cog, pong_main.cog, and let's start assigning those
values. </p>

<ul>
    <li><p>1: Noteam_reset: These should be one of
        the last 8 walkplayers- the ones where the players
        without a team respawn.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>2: Red_reset: One of the walkplayers for
        the red player</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>3: Gold_reset: One of the walkplayers for
        the gold player</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>4: Red_ball: The Thing where the pongball
        starts when red serves</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>5: Gold_ball: The Thing where the
        pongball starts when gold serves</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>6: Red_paddle: The red paddle</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>7: Gold_paddle: The gold paddle</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>8: Red_button: Red's serve button</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>9: Gold_button: Gold's serve button</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>10: Red_cancel: Red's cancel switch</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>11: Gold_cancel: Gold's cancel switch</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>12: Redscore, Redscore1: The surfaces
        that display Red's score</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>13: Goldscore, Goldscore1: The surfaces
        that display Gold's score</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>14: Red_center: The center sector of the
        3 with which red moves his paddle</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>15: Red_left: The left sector of the 3
        with which red moves his paddle</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>16: Red_right: The right sector of the 3
        with which red moves his paddle</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>17: Gold_center: The center sector of the
        3 with which gold moves his paddle</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>18: Gold_left: The left sector of the 3
        with which gold moves his paddle</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>19: Gold_right: The right sector of the 3
        with which gold moves his paddle</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>20: Red_enter: The sector in the red
        entrance shaft that sticks the player in the red control
        room</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>21: Gold_enter: The sector in the gold
        entrance shaft that sticks the player in the gold control
        room</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>22: Gold_score: The sector which gold has
        to hit the ball into to score on red- the sector is right
        in front of Red's control room.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>23: Red_score: The sector which red has
        to hit the ball into to score on gold- the sector is
        right in front of Gold's control room.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>4. Setting up PONG_SAFEENTRY.COG</h3>

<p>Ok, that wasn't so hard, now was it? We're now
ready to move on to Pong_Safeentry.cog. This one's a lot easier
than the last.</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>1. Mark_red1: The sector at the VERY
        BOTTOM of red's entry shaft- below the Red_Enter sector
        you set in Pong_Main.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>2. Mark_gold1: The sector at the VERY
        BOTTOM of gold's entry shaft- below the Gold_Enter sector
        you set in Pong_Main.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>3. Ghost_red: The ghost you placed at the
        top of red's entrance shaft</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>4. Ghost_gold: The ghost you placed at
        the top of gold's entrance shaft</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>5. Setting up PONG_RESPAWN.COG</h3>

<p>Ok, and now onto the last cog, Pong_Respawn. If
you have exactly 8 sectors inside each of your control rooms,
proceed with this section. If you have more or less than 8
sectors in the control rooms, go down to the next section,
entitled &quot;THE HARD WAY&quot;.<br>
</p>

<h3><font color="#0000FF">THE EASY WAY</font></h3>

<ul>
    <li><p>1. Mark_red: The same sector as Red_enter
        in pong_main</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>2. Mark_gold: The same sector as
        Gold_enter in pong_main</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>3. Red1 - Red8: Each of the sectors which
        make up red's control room. The first sector is red1,
        second is red2, etc.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>4. Gold1 - Gold8: Each of the sectors
        which make up gold's control room. The first sector is
        gold1, second is gold2, etc.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><font color="#0000FF">THE HARD WAY</font></h3>

<p>For all of you who chose to be more creative with
your levels, you'll have to do a little more work. Don't worry,
this won't be all that difficult. First determine how many
sectors there are in each of your control rooms. Now open up
pong_respawn.cog in notepad, and find the section that looks like
this:<br>
<img src="8.jpg" align="left" hspace="0" width="543" height="139"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><br>
Now add to that list so there are the right number of sectors for
the red control room. Let's say you have 13 sectors instead of 8-
when you're done it should look like this:<br>
<img src="9.jpg" width="534" height="207"></p>

<p><br>
Now find the section that looks like this:<br>
<img src="10.jpg" width="533" height="128"><br>
And do the same, add the number of sectors so it's the same as in
gold's control room. Once again we'll go with the number 13.<br>
<img src="11.jpg" width="540" height="208"><br>
</p>

<p><br>
Now that you've done that, scroll down to the section that looks
like this:<br>
<img src="12.jpg" width="376" height="342"><br>
And change it so it has the right number of sectors for red and
gold, and looks like this:<br>
<img src="13.jpg" width="364" height="500"><br>
</p>

<p><br>
Then do the same for each of these:<br>
<img src="14.jpg" width="321" height="163"> <img src="16.jpg"
width="324" height="167"><br>
So they look like this:<br>
<img src="15.jpg" width="317" height="247"> <img src="17.jpg"
width="324" height="244"><br>
</p>

<p>Now save it, go back to the placed cogs section
and set Red1-Red13 and Gold1-Gold13 to the sectors which make up
your control centers for red and gold.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>6. FINAL SETUP</h3>

<p>Ok, set up your episode.jk and cogstrings.uni
like with any other level, then paste this into cogstrings.uni:<br>
