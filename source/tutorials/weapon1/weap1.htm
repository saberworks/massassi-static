In this tutorial we will change the model of the bryar weapon,
Using JED.
To do this you will need JED 0.81, an ungob program and 
a text editor(wordpad is probably best).
<BR><BR>
Open up res2.gob in your ungob program. Go to the 3do directory
and export bryv.3d0 and bryg.3d0. Now start up JED.
Make a simple weapon model like this:
<BR><BR>
<CENTER><img src="weap1.GIF"></CENTER>
<BR><BR>
Notice how it is compared to the player model? Your weapons 
should be about that size.
Now what you need to do is make the 3do. Rotate the sector/model 
by pressing F9. Make it so that the model points downwards.
Export the model as a 3do called "yourmodel".
Using Wordpad open up the model. About 16 lines down you should see:
<pre>
INSERT OFFSET 0 0 0
</pre>
Change it to:
<pre>
INSERT OFFSET  -0.001547   0.009132  -0.000272
</pre>
Now go down untill you find this:
<pre>
MESH 0

NAME yourmodel0

RADIUS   0.081138
</pre>
<BR><BR>
Change it to this:
<pre>
MESH 0

NAME K_Rhand

RADIUS   0.081138
</pre>
Now go to the very bottom of the page and  delete the very 
last line. Replace it with this:
<pre>
     0:  0x0000 0x00001        0       -1      -1        -1             0   0.000000   0.000000   0.000000   0.000000   0.000000   0.000000   0.000000   0.000000   0.000000  K_Rhand

</pre> 
Now save your model as bryg.3do, which replaces the old model.
Now we have to make the POV model. This is the one that you
see from inside the player.
Open up yourmodel.3do . Again, change the line:
<pre>
INSERT OFFSET   0 0 0
</pre>
into:
<pre>
INSERT OFFSET   0.004646   0.021351  -0.011998
</pre>
Now here is the hardest part. What you will need to do is
paste this into the top of yourmodel.3do, Just below
"MESHES 1" :
<BR><BR>
<pre>

MESH 0
NAME K_Rforearm
RADIUS 0
GEOMETRYMODE	4
LIGHTINGMODE	3
TEXTUREMODE	1

VERTICES 0


TEXTURE VERTICES 0


VERTEX NORMALS


FACES 0


FACE NORMALS


MESH 1

NAME K_Rshouldr

RADIUS   0.073759

GEOMETRYMODE	4
LIGHTINGMODE	3
TEXTUREMODE	0


VERTICES 0

TEXTURE VERTICES 0

VERTEX NORMALS

FACES 0

FACE NORMALS

</pre>
Now under that you should see:
<pre>
MESH 0
NAME yourmodel0
</pre>
Change it to:
<pre>
MESH 2
NAME K_Rhand
</pre>
Now go up to "MESHES 1" and change it to "MESHES 3"
After that you need to go to the very bottom and delete
the bottom line. Replace it with this:
<BR><BR>
<pre>
     0:  0x0000 0x00001       -1       -1       3        -1             1   0.000000   0.000000   0.000000   0.000000   0.000000   0.000000   0.000000   0.000000   0.000000  $$$DUMMY
     1:  0x0000 0x00001        0        3       2        -1             1   0.012023  -0.000456  -0.032048   0.000000   0.000000   0.000000  -0.000074   0.000000  -0.014126  K_Rforearm
     2:  0x0000 0x00001        2        1      -1        -1             0   0.000886   0.003522  -0.031342   0.000000   0.000000   0.000000  -0.000928   0.000000  -0.005522  K_Rhand
     3:  0x0000 0x00001        1        0       1        -1             1   0.015342  -0.025281   0.041360   0.000000   0.000000   0.000000   0.007833   0.000000  -0.013829  K_Rshouldr
</pre>
<BR><BR>
Now go up a few lines untill you see "HIERARCHY NODES 1"
Change it to "HIERARCHY NODES 4".
Now save this model as "bryv.3do". Put the models into your
JK/resource/3do directory and run JK. From internal mode you
should see:
<BR><BR>
<CENTER><img src="weap2.GIF"></CENTER>
<BR><BR>
And from external mode you should see:
<BR><BR>
<CENTER><img src="weap3.GIF"></CENTER>
<BR><BR>
As you can probably tell this model doesn't look much like
weapon of any kind. It was made purely for the purpose of
this tutorial. For your own weapons you'd probably want to
make a model that's a little bit better looking than that.
<BR><BR>
This was part 1 of the weapons tutorial. Part 2 will deal
with simple modifications of the weapon cog to change
sounds, projectiles and more.
<BR><BR>
NOTE: This method of making weapon 3dos is not the only way.
FIXXER,Pot-head and JonathanC each told me a different way 
that they made weapon 3dos. This method is similar to the
way LEC probably made the origanal JK weapons.
