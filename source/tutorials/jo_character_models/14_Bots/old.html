<p><font size="4">Making Your Model Into a Bot</font></p>

<p>Bot files allow your model to be used as an AI bot for multiplayer. 
Personally, I chose to copy an existing file and rename key text parts 
of it to my liking. You can find scripts within the directory /scripts/ 
within the assets0.pk3 file, named kyle.bot or tavion.bot, etc.</p>

<p>The file can be opened with Notepad, and should look something like this:</p>

<blockquote><font face="Fixedsys" color="#999999"><p>{<br>
name		"DarthVader"<br>
model		darthvader<br>
color1		0<br>
personality	/botfiles/darthvader.jk<br>
}</p></font></blockquote>

 	<td width="100" align="right"><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">name -</font></td>
	<td><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">name shown within the game, this will be the model's name in the player list</font></td>

	<td align="right"><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">model -</font></td>
	<td><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">the model that the bot uses</font></td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  	<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
	<td align="right"><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">color1 -</font></td>
	<td><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">the color used for the model's lightsaber on the bot</font></td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 	<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
	<td align="right"><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">personality -</font></td>
	<td><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">points towards the bot's behaviour scripts</font></td>
 </tr>

<p>Save this file as a .Bot file, put it into a Scripts directory, then 
pack the scripts directory straight into the zipped custom file!</p>

<p><font size="4">Bot File Behavior Scripts (.JKB Files)</font></p>

<p>Personally, I chose to copy an existing file and rename key text 
parts of it to my liking. You can find bot behaviour scripts within the 
directory /botfiles/ within the assets0.pk3 file. </p>

<p>Here, you can adjust the bots capabilities, what Force powers it has,
 what powers it uses most, how accurate it is, etc, as well as what it 
says in the text taunts and comments upon joining, dying, etc. It's 
pretty straightforward; I suggest taking a look at a few JKB files 
within the assets0.pk3 file.</p>

<p>Put the file in a folder "Botfiles" and place Botfiles into the zipped model file.</p>
