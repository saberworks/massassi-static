## Handling Shaders for JK2

Ok well I don't want to have to go over shaders completely -- check
[www.polycount.com](http://www.polycount.com/)
for tutorials on Quake 3 shaders for how to make things, glow, etc. Sine
Nomen has also published a tutorial on [creating custom
shaders](/tutorials/jo_custom_shaders/)
for Jedi Knight 2.

You will put the .shader files within the /Shaders/ folder and that
shall go into the main zip file as well. You should also include a file
Shaderlist.txt with the file that points to your shader file.

Example: **vader.shader** at the bottom of the list **shaderlist.txt**;
look for it in the folder /shaders/ within **assets0.pk3**.
