<p>Ok well I don't want to have to go over shaders completely -- check <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040422200408/http://www.polycount.com/" target="_blank">www.polycount.com</a> for tutorials on Quake 3 shaders for how to make things, glow, etc. Sine Nomen has also published a tutorial on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040422200408/http://www.massassi.net/tutorials/jo_custom_shaders/">creating custom shaders</a> for Jedi Knight 2.</p>

<p>You will put the .shader files within the /Shaders/ folder and that 
shall go into the main zip file as well. You should also include a file 
Shaderlist.txt with the file  that points to your shader file.

</p><p>Example: <b>vader.shader</b> at the bottom of the list <b>shaderlist.txt</b>; look for it in the folder /shaders/ within <b>assets0.pk3</b>.</p>
