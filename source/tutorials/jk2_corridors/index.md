Connecting Rooms Using Corridors  

-----

*This tutorial assumes that you can already make an individual room.*

**Included:** [corridors.map](corridors.map) (the final .map file for
this tutorial)

1.  Start off with making a simple room:
    
    ![](corridors01.gif)

2.  Now select one of the walls and use the Clipping tool
    ![](clipper.gif), cut a hole in the wall in the shape of the
    corridor you want.
    
    <table>
    <colgroup>
    <col style="width: 100%" />
    </colgroup>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p><strong>How to use the Clipping Tool:</strong></p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td><ol>
    <li>Select the Clipping tool by press 'X' or by clicking the button '<img src="clipper.gif" width="17" height="17" />'</li>
    <li>Click where you want the clipping to start and where you want it to finish</li>
    <li>The part of the brush which will be kept is highlighted with a different colour (in my case, yellow)</li>
    <li>Press 'Enter' to confirm the clip, press 'Ctrl+Enter' to select the other part of the brush, or press 'Shift+Enter' to keep both parts of the brush.</li>
    </ol></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

3.  You should end up with something like this:

4.  Now create an identical room but facing the opposite direction (you
    can select all the brushes in the room by shift+click, then
    duplicate with 'space', and finally rotate with ![](zrotate.gif)):

5.  Using a similar method to what you used to make your initial room;
    create a long, open-ended room (ie 2 walls, ceiling and floor) that
    fits the holes in your main rooms:

    *(Note this is a view from the side)*

6.  Now you should be ready to add spawn points and lights for a test
    compile. Here is a screenshot of the level running.
