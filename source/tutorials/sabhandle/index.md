### How to make new Saber Handles

By: (V)eRLiN  

Ok, this is my first tutor so bare with me hehe. If you do have any
problems understanding what I'm talking about just e-mail me.  

Tools you will need...  

* Conman or Gobex  
* Notepad  

Ok first off open Conman/Gobex then open Res2.gob ( it is in your jedi
knight/resource directory in case you didn't know ) then go to the cog
directory. Then scroll down to the weap\_saber.cog and extract it to
your desktop. Then go back and look at the 3do directory and write down
some of the cool names you see or just ones you want to write down.  
ex: yundead.3do

Ok next go to notepad and look at weap\_saber.cog and scroll down till
you see:  

```
model povModel=sabv.3do local  
model saberMesh=sabg.3do local  
```
Â   
and change it to  

```
model povModel=yundead.3do local  
model saberMesh=yundead.3do local  
```

or whatever 3do you wrote down. Now save the file and make a folder in
your jk/resource directory called cog. Now but the cog you just edited
into that folder and play a game and check out your new handle. This
will work for MP as well as SP.

Ok well if you have any problems with this e-mail me and I will fix what
ever it is that needs to be.
