Q: How do I add highlights and shadows correctly?

> A: For highlights and shadows just make a new layer. Use the spraycan on
> a very low opacity and spray over with either black or white where you
> want the shadow to be. If you want a shadow, use black and set the layer
> to multiply or color burn (50%). For highlights, color dodge (75%). They
> should be located in a position relative to where the supposed
> lightsource is, and the light source, as well as the length of the
> protrusion determine the size of the highlight/shadow.

Q: Where can I find good tutorials and such for beginners?

> A: Try the *Photoshop Workshop*. (Note: site is defunct, use google to search 
> for photoshop tutorials).

Q: For say, rock, I know how to make the basic rock by simply using
airbrushes and stuff, but how does one create all the cracks and
detailed crevices?

> A: You can either use texture overlays, modifying the textures
> saturation, brightness, etc, or you can draw the black cracks, set the
> layer to overlay, duplicate the layer, invert the brightness, and then
> offset by 1x1.

Q: For texture overlays, my photoshop only has like 4 crappy ones. Where
can I find new ones or make better ones?

> A: No, don't use ones from photoshop or psp. Use photos, or make your
> own, or get other people's. The three best ones that I've found are

Q: For photo-realistic stuff, like texture overlays, they normally
wouldn't tile very well. How do I make something so detailed tile
without big blur spots?

> A: Offset the image by half its dimensions. Use the clone tool to go
> over the edges.

Q: This question really isn't related, but how does it feel to be the
master of MATs that everyone looks up to?

> A: No comment.

Q: Is Photoshop 5.5 or 6 better?

> A: I've never used 6, but everyone else claims that 5.5 is the best
> version so far.

Q: How come after I've made a texture it always looks too blurred, and
when i sharpen it, it looks too sharp?

> A: Use harder brushes to draw. I don't like sharpening. It's a pain in
> the ass to do correctly. Don't blur things to heavily, either.

Q: What do you do to add a dirty look to a texture?

> A: Make a brown base. Then use the airbrush with a small brush head and
> draw circles. Do this over and over until you get a lumpy pattern. Add a
> gaussian noise of 5. Duplicate layer. Desaturate. Emboss on a low
> setting. Set layer to overlay. Adjust color/brightnesses until it looks
> the way you want. Photo overlays are also good.

Q: What steps do you take to make a texture tile properly?

> A: To make a texture tile properly, offset each layer by half of the
> image's dimensions, ie you offset a 256x256 image by 128x128. Then you
> use the clone tool to blend the seams out. You could also draw things
> over the seams.

Q: How do you make rust?

> A: Pretty much the same method as dirt, only you use a wider rane of
> colors, such as red, brown, and orange.

Q: Do you use any custom brushes, and if so, from where?

> A: Yes, I do. However, I obtained them a while ago, and I don't remember
> where I got them.

![](faqbreaker.jpg)

Q: Do you use any plugins?

> A: I use a few of the default plugins that come with Photoshop, and a
> few custom filters such as Eye Candy 4000 and Xenofex to get effects
> that it would be too tedious to do out by hand.

![](faqbreaker.jpg)

Q: Where do you get inspiration for your textures?

> A: Sometimes pictures, sometimes places I've visted, and sometimes from
> other games in an attempt to prove myself. Most of the time it's just
> randomly doodling until something forms, however.
