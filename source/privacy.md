The Massassi Temple is currently run by a single person, Brian E. Lozier, with 
contributions from community members going back almost 25 years.

Massassi currently uses a single "counter" script hosted by a 3rd party to
count visitors to the site.  This privacy-respecting counter script is
provided by <a href="https://www.goatcounter.com/">Goat Counter</a>, an open
source analytics project.

If you prefer not to be counted, you have a few options:

* Enable your browsers "Do Not Track" functionality.
* Use an ad blocker, most of which should block the counter by default.
* Manually block the counter script: <code>gc.zgo.at/count.js</code>

I do not run any advertising and I do not share any information with any 3rd
party company.

If you register (for either the main site level/comments system or the forums),
the information you enter will be stored in a database owned by me.  Your
email address will not be shared, it is solely used to send password reset
messages on the main site and possibly forum notifications if you enable them.

I do not ask for any personal information, not even your Real Name.  Feel free
to register with a handle, nickname, or pure gibberish.

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact me via the forums,
Discord, or email.

-Brian
