     Bleech.. Well, it would seem that something is wrong with telefragged's (jn.com's host) ftp server.. I've only talked to Nijaan of the spaceport, but he says he can't access his ftp directory and neither can we - I assume it's the same with every site.. What this means is that we can't post any new levels until this is fixed.. The second we do get it up and running, levels will flow like fountains.. On an unrelated note, I think Bri somehow sent me his sickness over the net.. I'm not sure how he pulled it off, but I'll figure it out..

        <a href="http://www.jediknight.net/" target="_top">JediKnight.net</a> got a really awesome looking new design.  It loads a lot faster, but when are these people going to learn that if you want a site to load fastest, you <i>cannot</i> put the news in a table.  For you non-html literate, to render a table, the browser has to download the whole thing, and *then* render it.  On the other hand, you can put it like Massassi does - it displays the news text as it's downloading.

        As mentioned a few days ago, I'm working on an advanced architecture tutorial. Unfortunately, I'm having to re-write the first half due to a bug (read: I messed up).  Hopefully it will be out by Friday (taking all the screenshots that go along with this tutorial take the most time).  Just to let you know, it will cover a really cool pipe junction, as well as different techniques for creating framerate-friendly architecture that is very detailed and pleasing to the eye.

        On a side note, a virus called CIH is scheduled to strike tomorrow.  Bascially it sits in your computers memory until a certain date, then fries your Bios.  I *strongly* suggest you download the CIH checker to see if your computer is infected.  Symantec (makers of Norton Anti-Virus) has a program that lets you <a href="http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/kill_cih.html" target="_top">detect the virus</a>.  If you have it, you'll have to download the anti-virus software to kill it.

        I'm not very happy with X-Wing Alliance.  I finished the first level, which was okay, but then the second level was straight lame.  You sit in the gunner position of this freighter ship (which is almost exactly like the Falcon) and shoot crates.  You don't get to pilot the ship, you just shoot crates.  So I shot all the crates in sight, and my console was targetting crates that were off the screen.  However, the pilot wouldn't move the ship so I could see them.  I don't know how LEC can release this game -- 1.  It's just like the latest 3d versions of X-Wing, TIE Fighter, and X-Wing Vs. TIE Fighter.  2.  It's buggy (the scripted sequences don't work right most of the time).  3.  Once you're playing a mission, if you fail an objective, it won't tell you -- so you end up having to finish the rest of the mission, but then it tells you that you failed and you have to start over.  4.  The targetting system is way off -- I really think there should be a key to target your next objective -- at least that way you'd know *what* you were supposed to be doing.  Anyway, I hope I didn't anger any fans of the game, but those are my opinions.
        <br><BR>
        If anyone remembers ol' 8t88, who was with me when I first started this site, I talked to him a bit yesterday evening.  He said that he was working on some Half-Life editing projects (no pages though).  I still don't understand why (any idiot can edit with Worldcraft), but he promised that he'd port his level over to JK if he ever got it finished (I'm not holding my breath).<br><BR>
        Happy Sunday everyone, have a great week.

            Word on the street has it that some guy named Alexei Novikov has released a program called "JED Beta .93"..

            <font color="gray">
            <ul>
            <li>Fixed a bug in extracting .COG from GOB/GOOs when you try to edit a .COG that's in the game's GOB/GOO files.
            <li>You can now change the CMP used as palette when you view a 3DO in Resource Picker.
            <li>Added an option to hide things/lights when not in thing/light mode. 
            <li>Holding "Ctrl" and "Alt" while dragging objects now limits its transformation to one grid axis. Use "Ctrl+Alt+Z" (press Z while dragging) to toggle between snapping to X and Y grid axis. 
            <li>You can now manipulate shapes (prefabs) - import them from sectors and delete them.

                   Saberworks: New Screenshots for a Week

                   <a href="http://saberworks.jedinights.com/" target="_top">Saberworks</a>, the editing group working on (among other things) <a href="http://saberworks.jedinights.com/pote.htm" target="_top">Pride of the Empire</a>, has announced that they will be releasing two screenshots a day for the next 7 days.  Actually, it was me who announced that over there, since it's my level.  Anyway, you can take a look at the screenshots over at their page, or go directly to the <a href="http://saberworks.jedinights.com/shots4.htm">Level 4 Screenshots Page</a>.

                   Just some notes on the progress of POTE:  We have lost some members, but things continue to progress (at an increasing pace lately).  Unfortunately, we will not have 7 SP levels at release time.  This is due to the fact that more than half of our level designers quit without finishing their levels.  Never fear, however, we have at least 4 full-length SP levels almost completed, with a small boss-type level forthcoming.  Right now we are in the process of revising some of the story, as well as getting the cutscenes in order (we *will* have fully computer animated SMK cutscenes, modelled by our kick-butt modeller, \/\/ing |\|ut).  Soon we will need a full cast of voice actors for the dialog, so watch the Saberworks site (as well as this one) for the announcement.  Thanks everyone for being patient with us!

                    <a href="http://www.digitalnsx.com/lsp/" target="_top">Last Stand Productions</a> has just announced that all future releases will be for Mysteries of the Sith only.  This is due to the fact that MotS has more options available to the editors (eweb, colored lighting, etc).  Don't fret though, I've seen the plans: all weapons will be replaced, so we don't have to sweat those crappy MotS weapons (seeker, carbonite gun, I mean come on).  Perhaps you will remember <a href="http://massassi.jedinights.com/levels/dfasve.htm">Death From Above II: Special Viagra Edition</a> - which was LSP's last release.  I must say that DFA2 is still my favorite weapons addon pack ever released.  I have also had the pleasure of checking out some of the level work Ramen (leader of the pack) is working on -- it kicks.  I'll post some screenshots here once Ramen sends me some.

                    Just a quick plug for some of the community message boards that have been seeing some action.  Our host, <a href="http://www.jedinights.com/" target="_top">Jedi Nights</a>, has recently added some new forums.

                    Yes, as was pointed out on the message boards yesterday, I did type the date wrong.  Anyway, it's not worth the trouble of changing it now.  I picked up X-Wing Alliance at Staples for $30.00.  It's exactly the same as X-Wing and TIE Fighter (I haven't played X-Wing Vs. TIE Fighter yet).  I don't see what the fuss is about -- sure the graphics are cool, but if you pick up the X-Wing collector's series, you get the same 3d graphics anyway.  I'll play through some levels later on and see if it gets any better.

                    " target="_top">The Harjassk Diplomacy</a> and <a href="http://command.jedinights.com/" target="_top">The Command Chamber</a> sent an email in regarding yesterday's announcement of EP1 titles:
                    <blockquote><font color="gray">
                    Recently at Massassi, Brian wondered what an episode 1 game, called the gungan frontier, was about. I read somewhere that it was another lucas learning title, although what the exact nature of the gameplay is, i'm not sure. I hope this helps, anyway.
                    </font></blockquote>
                    On one hand, I'm glad they didn't name a shooter something weak like "gungan frontier," but on the other hand, I really want another Star Wars game that's comparable to JK.  Come on LEC, announce a First Person Shooter already!

                         I am working my way through an advanced architecture tutorial, I should have it done by the end of the week. I have 90% of the text written (it's a loooong one) - all I have left is a few paragraph's and the screenshots to go with it.  Why am I posting this?  We haven't had a tutorial or article around here in quite a while, and I just wanted to let everyone know that we're not done yet!  I hope this helps people with getting some good architecture out there.  Remember, before you release a level, make sure there isn't a square, boring room in it -- it's just not worth it, and people don't much like to play boxy levels like that.

                           Even though JK isn't a true 'First Person Shooter' (due to the inclusion of the 3rd person view), I'm going to use it for lack of a better word.  Anyway, I, along with others in the community, were disheartened by the fact that LEC didn't announce an FPS with the crop of TPM games.  I have 3 words: <I>There's Still Hope</I>.  Why do I say this?  Here is a quote out of the most recent issue of Computer Gaming World:
                           <blockquote><font color="gray">
                           In addition to the two Star Wars Episode 1 games featured in this feature, three more unannounced titles should ship by year's end.</font></blockquote>
                           That's all it said, but how could LEC abandon all the loyal fans of the Dark Forces series?  I don't believe they can. First of all, back shortly after the release of Mysteries of the Sith, in an interview with one of LEC's employees, it was said that they were <I>not</I> going to do another sequel to Dark Forces, but that they were working on another FPS.  Please LEC, give us dedicated servers!  I'll keep everyone posted if I find out any more info -- keep your fingers crossed.

The page hadn't been updated in a long time, so I decided to fire off an email to him. Here is what I got in reply:

                             After several months ( i was out of Spain ), I restarted the project. As i'm rewriting all, it will take some time to reach the old status, but at least,
                             it's about 300% faster and reliable than the previous project.<br><br>
                             I will update the homepage with some info about the actual status.

Many good places to snipe from, hide or place proximity mines. With more than 4 players, it will probably get a little crowded. Be light of foot when dueling around the cliff, or you may just go crunch. A 3D accelerator is reccomended, as the transparency slows down machines that lack them.</font>

I've played this level, and so far, it's got the best architecture I've ever seen in any level, LEC or not.

If you need your level/mod tested (and I suggest everyone do this), contact his group (via the above email address) and they'll test it out for you.  I urge all editors to take this seriously, it's terrible to see a level full of bugs when it could have been excellent.

                                              Well, my trip got cut short, so I'm back about a week early.  Thanks to Slug and the rest of the staff for keeping up on the news (what little there was).  JK news has been in a slump lately, I see, but I guarantee that JK/MotS editing will be around at least until another Star Wars first person shooter comes out.

                                               This is a new Darth Vader enemy.  He has ambient breathing.  He uses two force powers, Force Grip which he uses quite often, and Force Saber Throw!  He says "If you will not join me then you will meet your destiny!" and then throws his lightsaber at you! Unfourtunatly I couldn't make the saber go directly back to him and have him make use of it (partially because he moves and might miss the returning saber and partially because I couldn't make him take the saber back (I think I may have found a way to fix this and will send in a second version if I can make it work). If you attack him while his saber is still gone he will punch you hard. This is a Mots only enemy.</font></blockquote>

Ryan, from the command chamber agreed to help me out, just one catch - he needs the FTP pass, something I don't have (I typed it in CuteFTP once, where it's stored as nothing more then asteriks then I lost the email that contained the password..).. Until another staff member emails me the password, we're kinda screwed.. Until then, just use the discussion board (not review board) for your editing questions..

                                                              Secondly, the lack of news updates.. Obviously we take some credit for this, but the fact is there just isn't much news out there right now.. None gets sent to us, and apparently none gets sent to other JK sites either, as most of their news posts are about XWA (d'oh!). I also always feel weird about taking news from other sites considering most people who come here go to jk.net and/or jn.com anyways (why shove the same old news down everyone's throats?) Anyways, there's our excuse :) We will keep trying to find news though of course, and will as usual post stuff sent to us as promptly as possible.

The reason it is funky is beacuse it has a funk song in it for the background music.  The funk song was completely composed and recorded on a 4-track by me and my friend. Abandonded Land Pad is a SABERS ONLY level. It's set at an abandonded space land pad floating in space.  The land pad has now been turned into a giant junk heap floating in water beneath it.  Tons of obsticals to jump around on!

And, if I may say so myself, they're quite cool. We're already hosting an assortment of message boards for various groups, such as <a href="http://www.jedinights.com/zeldatc/">Zelda TC</a>, <a href="http://members.xoom.com/MrGoalie/main.htm">Sam 'n Max Project</a>, <a href="http://www.digitalnsx.com/lsp/">Last Stand Productions</a>, the <a href="http://www.boab.com">National Star Wars League</a>, <a href="http://www.imperialcenter.com">Imperial Center</a> with more to come soon. Anyways, they're very cool so enjoy!<p>On a slightly different note, <a href="http://www.outpostd34.com">Outpost</a> is also going through some rough times right now, especially with a server that seems to continuously refuse to work properly, which has all but stopped the addition of new sites. new features, etc. However I'm sorting through all the problems as I can, and soon we'll be running at full capacity with tons and tons of cool stuff, with a new (working) server in the near future so stick around.

The new section has been created by us at <a href="http://www.jedinights.com/holocron/">Holocron Editing</a>, not <a href="http://www.jedinights.com/">Jedinights.com</a>. Just had to clarify that and remind Puke to always use blockquote and a <font color="gray">gray</font> font when quoting people :)

This is what Justin0 has to say about it:<blockquote><font color="gray"></font></blockquote>Hello everyone, Justin0 here from Holocron Editing. We've just added a major new section to the site, based around our exciting new MOD, Mara Jade, Identity Crisis. If you fully explore this new section then you'll find 9 interesting new screen shots from Level 1, a picture of our new Mara skin, and lots of cool facts about our project. We've also pledged to update this section frequently, so check back often!

Since BrianL is gone for a month, I can silently conquer this site (manacial laughter) Just kidding.  Anyway, in case you're interested, I'm going to be updating not just JK related stuff, but about certain game engines that are out and free on the Internet.  I've realized recently that many people are expressing the loss of faith of the game engine on the discussion board (heck, we might have to make another message board for whining about our game engine).  I'll also be posting about new games from LucasArts, and of course, The Phantom Menace.
