New Tutorial: Making Your Own Pong Levels

There was a lot of hullabaloo earlier in the week when Mike "LikWid" Watson released his <a href="/levels/jkpong.shtml">Jedi Knight Pong modification</a>, where he was cool enough to include info for other authors on how to make their own levels. Well, he's taken that generous gesture a step further and submitted <a href="/tutorials/pong/">a tutorial</a> here at Massassi. Included with the step-by-step instructions is an updated .zip file with all the essential COG scripts, templates, etc. you'll need to get going down the Pong Arena path. Mad props to LikWid for sending in <a href="/tutorials/pong/">his tutorial</a>.

I'm very pleased so far with the results of the MPG!  We will be adding new required files every weekend, so keep a look out!  I will be working on some enhancements to the system in the near future.<br><Br>
<ul>
<li>Addons IP Board - So you can host a game with whatever addon level/mod you want.
<li>Un-registration - If you want to unregister, you will be able to do it yourself (if you want to un-register now, just send me an email).
<li>Enhancements on the current release of both ReconDroid and our IP board so you can get info on games before you join. If you don't know, ReconDroid is a program that will ping the IP addresses on the IP Board, get the current number of players, your average ping, and list the addon level that is being played.  Watch for this soon.
</ul><br>
On to other things...
<br><br>
As you have probably noticed, our server has been a bit slow lately.  On top of that, about 1/3 of the people I surveyed often can't get to our subdomains (http://something.massassi.net).  Our tech support guys have been looking into this problem, but no resolution has yet been found.  I suspect its server load (during peak times, we overload our memory), but I can't be sure.<br><br>
Anyway, this weekend I'm going to purchase a computer and install Linux on it.  I'm going to learn all the software necessary to administer a killer web server - and as soon as that's finished, The Massassi Temple will be purchasing a killer new box to serve our network.  I'm estimating that the new server will be up and running in about two months.
<br><br>
Does that mean you have to deal with these problems for two months!?  No!  I am working with UGO to take the forums off this server, which will basically leave this bad-boy w/out a load (the forums use the most CPU time and RAM).  I am also working to get some more RAM added to the server.  No exact dates on the above two items, but I am working as fast as I can.

Chronicles is run by Arby, the former editor-in-chief of the well-received Darkness Falls.  Dedicated to a motto of "Inane, Insane, and Possibly Informative," the first issue of Chronicles is filled with great new content, including a secret look at a hidden underground gaming community, a preview of <i>Soldier of Fortune</i>, the first review of <i>Asheron's Call</i> to take into account the people playing the game, a feature on hardware shopping, columns from several personalities in the gaming community, and underground info from everybody's favorite conspiracy theorists, the Tinfoil Hat.</font></blockquote>

This came in today from Mike Starr:

<blockquote><font color="gray">The Jedi Knight Screensaver Project is going very well so far, and it is now time to start auditions for the next phase.  The screensaver also supports music (MIDI format) to accompany the screensaver.  Break out your keyboards 
and try your hand at a Star Wars medley for the project.  If it's just a variety of Star Wars tunes strung together with short pauses between them, 
that's good too, but don't just send me a bunch of separate songs because I can't make them into one song.  Also, the longer the music the better.  It 
should take a long time for the song to repeat.<br>
<br>
On a side note, although I have gotten several pics so far, I haven't seen anything from many of you who I remember getting files from.  Remember, if you sent your pic(s) before I announced the re-opening of the project, I don't have it.<br>

I just uploaded LikWid's JK Pong and I just have to mention it.  I was his main beta tester and I must say it's one of the most creative and most fun JK mods there is.  It's all in one GOB that goes in your Episode directory, so no worrying about running JK with a batch file or Patch Commander.  It has a scoring system that adds the difference between your and your opponent's score to your score in JK after the match so that you can have little tournaments by playing several matches, and after so many matches the player with the most points wins the tournament.  And it's simply a lot of fun.  Each of the five levels requires a certain technique.  And included is a "for authors" file that explains how to make your own Pong levels.  I strongly encourage you to download it and try it out with a friend.  You can play for hours.  And I hope that people will start making their own Pong levels too.  Ok, I'm stepping off my rant box now.&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(c;</B>

<font color="gray">Remember Pong from your video game days?  This is Pong for Jedi Knight!  Compete with one or more players in five challenging levels, each requiring its own set of skills.  Have mini-tournaments with your friends.  Definitely one of the most unique mods for Jedi Knight, completely contained in one GOB file that simply goes in your Episode directory.  Includes information for authors on how to make your own Pong levels.</font>

Wow, I can't stop announcing stuff about the MPG for some reason.  There are actually two things.  First, they've posted news about their new <a href="http://www.massassi.net/mpg/logos.shtml" target="_top">button page</a> which has 3 images you can use if you feel like linking to the MPG.  Second, I wanted to mention that if you registered during the BETA period (when I announced it on the message board), you must re-register!  The old database was completely purged and we started anew yesterday.
