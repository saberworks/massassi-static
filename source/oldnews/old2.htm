<blockquote>
<font color="white"><font face="Arial"><span style="font-family: Arial">
Well, Alexei Novikov of <a href="http://www.darkjedi.com" target="_top">Code Alliance</a> has written two new articles on editing. The first is entitled
"<a href="http://www.jediknight.net/editing/articles/article1.htm" target="_top">Level
Editing-What's the Deal?</a>" that discusses why people devote so much time to editing a game, and the
second deals with <a href="http://www.jediknight.net/editing/articles/article2.htm" target="_top">Vectors</a> but is pretty technical. Both are a good read.

Tutorial Program For Internet Explorer 4 Users
</strong><small>- Brian</small></span></font>
<blockquote>
<font color="white"><font face="Arial"><span style="font-family: Arial">
Okay, this tutorial program will only work for IE4 users, so I apologize
to you Netscape Junkies.  When the Netscape version is complete it will be
posted, until then, you will just have to read the online versions.
Basically this program let's you browse through the tutorials offline in
an easy to use format.  It includes all the Basic Editing Techniques, plus
all the tutorials.  If you have any problems, or don't like the program, there
is an uninstall option.<BR><BR>
There are some required DLL files for this version, but if
you already have them, no need to download them again.  Just run the program
first, and it will tell you which DLLs you need (many times, they are already
on your computer from commercial software packages). For a list of which
DLL files are in which of the following zip files, click <a href="dlls.txt">here</a>.
Here are the files:
<ul>
<li><a href="mttsetup.zip">mttseup.zip (The Tutorial Program)</a> (2.47m)
<li><a href="msinet.zip">msinet.zip</a> (50k)
<li><a href="misc_dll.zip">misc_dll.zip</a> (354k)
<li><a href="msvbm50.zip">msvbm50.zip</a> (682k)
</ul>
Just extract the DLL files to your Windows/System directory, OR the directory you
install the actual program into. Then, extract the mttsetup.zip
files to their own directory, and run "setup.exe."<BR><BR>
Thanks goes to <a href="mailto:webmaster@thewebxpress.com">Dark Knight</a>
for creating that program.

Beginners Cog Tutorial

<blockquote>
<font color="white"><font face="Arial"><span style="font-family: Arial">
This tutorial was submitted by <a href="mailto:hill@golden.net">Jon Hill</a>.
Here's his explanation:<blockquote><font color="silver">
The attached zip is a Wordpad document tutorial, the subject of
which is a very detailed explanation of the two methods of displaying
text to the player's screen. What's the big deal you ask? Well, simply
put, the latest version of JKSpecs (ver 0.3) doesn't include any
explanation whatsoever for the concatanation commands regarding string
output. These are very powerful commands in that they provide a great
amount of flexibility and control over the output to the player(s)
during a game. Pre-formatted text and data variables can be mixed
seamlessly on a single line creating a readable and comprehensive way of
displaying game data.</font></blockquote>

Sample JED Files
</strong><small>- Brian</small></span></font>

<blockquote>
<font color="white"><font face="Arial"><span style="font-family: Arial">
I have compiled 3 JED files that might be of interest to people.  Why make them
available to download?  Well I think a lot of people are missing the power of
the cleaving and deleting technique (there will be a tutorial in a few weeks).
There are some awesome effects that can be done with cleaving and deleting, as shown
in the JED files.  Remember, these aren't gobs, so you have to open them in JED.
There were some custom cogs used in one of them, but they of course aren't included
in the JED file, so if you gob and try to play the levels, they won't be of much use.
<blockquote><font color="silver">
<B><font color="white">1. stairs.jed</font></B> - a pretty good looking staircase.  It has supports, etc, to make it
look realistic.<br>
<B><font color="white">2. tutor.jed</font></B> - a 3 room level with some interesting features inside, including
ramps up each side and some cool platforms.<br>
<B><font color="white">3. untitled.jed</font></B> - a diagonal cleaved level (try it, it's hard) that has a hole in the
center, sector thrust and particles going up through the hole, and through a neat piece
of architecture in the ceiling.</font></blockquote>
Please don't think I'm saying these are marvels of architecture.  They are just there
to demonstrate cleaving and deleting.  Download the files <a href="samples.zip">here</a>.

So Where's This Tutorial Program?

<blockquote>
<font color="white"><font face="Arial"><span style="font-family: Arial">
Good Question.  In case you haven't been reading the constant .plan updates
from myself and Dark Knight from over at <a href="http://workshop.votj.com/"

to organize and categorize all the tutorials we have at The Massassi Temple.
Unfortunately, we ran into some snags in the process of packaging and converting
them.  When can you expect it?  Well, Dark Knight has threatened my life with demands
that I give him a list of our tutorials by difficulty by 2pm Pacific (today).  So
if that's any indicator, it's close.  Look for more on that later today or

Heya all Darkness Falls subscribers!
<BR><BR>
I apologise for the lack of update emails, but life has been pretty hectic
lately. Anyway, as most of you by now probably know, Darkness Falls
converted from a online magazine to a more conventional articles site. The
site alos changed address slightly and is now located at
<a href="http://www.jediknight.net/darkfall/" target="_top">
http://www.jediknight.net/darkfall </a>
<BR><BR>
The content remained the same though - just a different format. Here's a
summary of the articles added since the change -
<BR><BR>
*Cutscene Tutorials*<BR>
Jonathon Clark and Pele each wrote seperate articles on the two styles of
cutscenes used in Jedi Knight. Clark took a detailed look at SMK video
cutscenes, whilst Pele investigated how to create in-game cutscenes as seen
in MotS.
<BR><BR>
*Movie Previews*<BR>
I just recently posted an article previewing this upcoming Summer of Movies.
Including the likes of Godzilla, Armageddon and The Truman Show.
<BR><BR>
*Story Continuations*<BR>
Since the move two new chapters have been added to the Interactive Story
taking it in all new directions. Look for a conclusion in upcoming chapters.
<BR><BR>
And what's coming up? Well, an in-depth skin editing tutorial by none other
than Al MacDonald himself is in the works plus some previews of upcoming JK
projects. I will also be punching out a ton of movie reviews for the hell of
it as well ;)

A Little Late, But...

<font color="white"><font face="Arial"><span style="font-family: Arial">

cut out the editing stuff.  If you're interested in reading the whole thing, click on

<blockquote><font color="silver" size="-1">
Well, and finally something I was planning to say when I started it. There are a couple of uncertaincies in JED. First, about multiselection. Should I make texturing tools work on surface multiselections? It might be useful at times, but it'll mess up the texturing from 3D Preview. That needs to be thought over. Another complication is cleaving non-convex surfaces. In some situations it may lead to formation of more than 2 surfaces. That screws me up BIG time. And it isn't a piece of cake to detect and handle this case either. So I'm afarid I'll have to leave it up to you not to make such cleaves. I also plan to add some geometry recovery tools for advanced users (constructing a sector from a set of surfaces and a surfaces from a set of vertices and deleting surfaces at will). I'm sure I'm gonna regret this and the newbies will start using it an make really messed up levels :-). But I think these tools might really come in handy.

Jed Beta 3 Posted

<font color="white"><font face="Arial"><span style="font-family: Arial">
There has been talk of messed up textures in Jed Beta .51. One of the solutions
offered was to finish the level in Jed Beta .51, then open the jkl in Jed 3, fix
the textures, then re-save it.  So, in light of the fact that most sites
don't have the older version posted anymore, it has been posted in our files
section.  Good luck.

Alexei Novikov .plan Update
</strong><small>- Brian</small></span></font>
<blockquote>
<font color="white"><font face="Arial"><span style="font-family: Arial">
If you don't know who Alex is... anyway.
The programmer of JED has updated his .plan on <a href="http://www.jediknight.net/finger" target="_top">
Jedi Finger</a>.  Very intersting stuff, take a look:
<blockquote><font color="silver" size="-1">
OK, now it's time for something that .plan was meant for. Some information, some ranting, some babbling, some bitching, that sort of things. 
<BR><BR>
Several people have asked about "the state of JED" recently. I posted a message to JED Messageboard, but it won't hurt to write it here as well. 
<BR><BR>
I've spent quite a bit of time doing some research - looking at Glide, MESA and software 3D rendering techniques. I figured a few things out. Hopefully (if I have time), one of the next versions of JED will have 3D Preview use a Voodoo/Voodoo2 card if you have one. <BR><BR>
Ah, BTW, MESA (it's an implementation of OpenGL by freelance programmers). All I can say - I surely respect the guys who spend their own time writing those things, but hey, how about caring a little bit about mere mortals? I really can't rely on it the way it is now. Pity, MESA could've saved me some troubles. <BR><BR>
But this isn't gonna make it to the very next version. I plan so much asked things like multiselection and undo for the next one. I have multiselection working for sectors now. Basically all editing operations work on multiselection (editing, moving, deleting, copying, cleaving), but there're some complications with merging. As a matter of fact, merging wasn't done as it should've been. It was inconvenient and it would choke when merging certain sectors. I intend to fix it now. I'll also try to expand cleaving to handle non-convex sectors and surfaces (at least some of them). That'll give you much more flexibility in altering the level geometry. <BR><BR>
BTW, the next JED probably won't require OpenGL. If you have it, you could use it in JED (for wireframe and 3D preview), but if you don't, JED will work without it. It was a bit ridiculous, wasn't it - 400K of JED plus 650K of OpenGL to be able to run it. 
<BR><BR>
And, as usual - don't ask "when" - I don't know. Even approximately. When I know, I'll say. 
</font></blockquote>
I'm looking forward to the multiselection and eventual Voodoo card support.
