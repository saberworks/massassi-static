Alright, I personally hate April Fool's day, but all the rest of the staff members seem to like it for whatever reason.  They've been planning this huge joke for the past month or so, and I'm sworn to secrecy.  Please note that I have nothing to do with it.  I'm just warning you, when some serious news pops up, please take it with a grain of salt.

<b>Description:</b>
<font color="gray">My Ninja Kage skin with my voice acting replaces Kyle Katarn. Many of the normal characters are now zombies, both in SP and MP. Features:
<ul>
<li>Five new ninja besides Kage (kah-gay; shadow) for MP games: Hayashi (ha-yah-she; forest/nature), Gouka (goh-ka; hell fire), Denkou (den-koh; lightning), Hyougen (he-yoh-gen; ice/snow field), and Shiro (she-row; white)
<li>Authentic, magic Ninja To (nin-ja-toe; ninja sword) with custom moves and bloody slashes!
<li>The sword is much more realistic--all moves do greater damage and can be swung faster
<li>When armed with the sword, you go into "stealth mode," which makes all of your footsteps silent
<li>Two hidden JK KEY animations for the sword are added--a cool stab and a fancy over-the-head slice
<li>Fire 2 now features my improved diagonal slash, horizontal slash, and stab combo
<li>Once you swing the sword for the first time, it is able to inflict damage to anything and anyone with a mere touch... a feature that SHOULD have been in JK in the first place!
<li>You can decapitate Stormtroopers sometimes in SP games
<li>Instead of smoke trails appearing when you chop off an arm or head, blood flies about
<li>Authentic Kunai (koo-n'eye; ninja throwing knives) replace the Bryar and Thermal Detonators
<li>Kick while holding any weapon (assign a key).  It actually damages opponents in MP games, unlike all other mods (as far as I know), and isn't just one  single hit like a punch--it's four!
<li>Perform a high-flipping jump attack (assign a key; only damages with sword)
<li>Use the Grappling Hook to reach far-off places
<li>Force Blind is replaced with Force Push (everyone in sight)
<li>Force Seeing and Persuasion have less annoying/stealthier noises
<li>Force Lightning is now ninja lightning magic that rains from the sky, surrounding you, as well as lancing forward from your hands
<li>Force Destruction is now Crimson Rain, falling from directly above you and scattering anyone and anything all around you
<li>Start the game equipped with 50 throwing knives, IR goggles, and 200 shields
<li>You can stick to and jump up walls as long as they're less than 90 degrees vertical
<li>You hold the sword in Japanese mid-stance and Force-using gestures are better
</ul></font>

I've done some trimming around here.  Most notable are the removal of a couple of our hosted sites.  Mehab4 of IS: Irrelevant Skins has moved on to bigger and better things.  He did release ISP2, which is a killer skin pack, but I haven't had time to add it to our files system yet.  Expect that in a few days.  Dragonfly of the JK Depot has chosen to close down his site as well.  Thanks to both sites for their time here, and we wish you the best of luck in the future.

I saw over at the <a href="http://www.swvault.com" target="_top">SWVault</a> that <a href="http://www.mcvnow.com/" target="_top">MCVnow</a> has posted a blurb about Star Wars Online - the Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game that was announced by LucasArts and Turbine a couple of weeks ago:
<blockquote><font color="gray">
<b>
LucasArts/Verant's massively multiplayer version of Star Wars, announced this month, will draw on gameplay aspects that made Verant's first game, EverQuest, a success. But to draw in a more mainstream audience, beginners are promised an intimidation-free environment. <br>
<br>
Simon Jeffery, recently appointed president of LucasArts, talks with MCV about the work-in-progress.<br>
</b>
<br>
"Practically all of the massively multiplayer online games at the moment are 'men in tights' games, and Star Wars has the real opportunity to expand online gaming to a more casual gamer," Jeffery says. "I think there's a high degree of intimidation to entry in online gaming. A lot of casual gamers are just put off by the fact that there's newbie-bashing and you have to be pretty hardcore to just know what's going on." <br>
<br>
There will be opportunities for players to hack and slash their way to the next level, Jeffery says, but LucasArts will emphasize the nonviolent aspects of the game. "We want people to be able to go in there and have an experience that might have no killing whatever, where level increasing is gained by doing good, or simply being a successful trader or a good spy." <br>
<br>
While gameplay might take a slightly different slant from that of EverQuest or Ultima Online, the business model will be the same, in that the game will be purchased at retail and there will be a monthly subscription to play. Pricing hasn't been finalized, although Jeffery agrees that right now, $10 per month (the price of the three current multiplayer leaders) is a mass-market-friendly price. <br>
<br>
Additionally, players will not be able to adopt core Star Wars characters, but will be able to become one of several races, possibly including droids, Jeffery says. Core Star Wars characters will appear in the game, but interactions with them will be at an NPC level. <br>
<br>
LucasArts is looking to ship the game around fall 2001

I've been taking a break from Massassi the past couple of days, and I plan to continue doing this until next week.  I'll still do random updates, but no big projects.<br><br>
Starting next week, however, I've got a lot of stuff to do.  I'm in the process of programming a complete forum system to replace the UBB.  I don't know that we'll implement it on Massassi itself (too much of a hassle), but we will use it on our other network sites.
<br><br>
I'm also in the process of implementing a new user authentication system on our various admin scripts.  This has forced me to learn the object-oriented side of PHP (*cough*).<br><br>
There's a ton more as well, but I don't want to announce them, in case I don't get to them as I plan to.  Let's just say, "You ain't seen nothing yet."

Got this email from Hebedee.
<blockquote><font color="gray">I would like to start off by saying that it has been a great run. The Jedi Knight Archives in it's life got more hits than most sites can only dream of. I estimate that between all the different counters we went through and all the times we reset them, we got around 400,000+ hits. Our reasons for closing it down, not enough time. Lately you have seen that we are only updating 1-2 times a week. It is pointless, in my opinion, to keep a site open that is not updated regularly. Second, Jedi Knight is in it's final stage. There are fewer and fewer players these days, meaning fewer and fewer visitors. Morriar and I would like to thank you all for submitting all your files etc. and using our resources to fulfill your Jedi Knight needs. It's great knowing that we go down in history with the largest collection of Jedi Knight levels online.....

play. If you can get on the elevator, good; if not don't lose sleep over it. 
It was made to be hard to get on.</font>

Just posting this so I can post some levels.. I'm nearly done with them fortunately.. Turns out there were a few repeats, and a few incorrectly sent ones, so the number of levels in my inbox dropped.. After tonight, I think I'll only have 5 more..
<br><br>
While I'm here, I'm gonna do a little advertising for Jepman.. I'm flat out impressed with the beautiful mats in <a href="http://forums.massassi.net/html/Forum5/HTML/000995.html" target="_top">this thread</a>. Very cool stuff...

<b>Description:</b>
<font color="gray">This is something I made ages ago, but couldn't be bothered to
release it or finish it. Here it is, still a little unfinished 
admittedly. You can navigate by the tubes. Cameras scattered 
around show you many areas. There are sewers, hangers, train 
stations, social areas and cargo bays. There are lots of force 
surges around and force is essential for some parts. I don't care
if you think that is unfair. And another thing. Why do I never 
INTEND to make a level?! My first level was just trying to get
doors to work, Operation: Fortra was just testing a new mat, 
and this was making Nar Shaddaa pillars.... duh! Sigma Vulcanis
was the only level I have started on purpose, and that was
Single Player initially...</font>

<font color="gray">This level takes place on a portion of a moonbase.  Mainly a gunner level, but there are two saber arenas.  One is a platform over a deep pit, and the other a room, with an upper story observation level.  Several domains surround the center moon face.  A Three story temple provides some safety from any dangers outside, and a nice little pool to take a refreshing dip in.  Designed for 2-32 players.</font>

Our killer network site, <a href="http://www.fcoutpost.com/" target="_top">Force Commander Outpost</a>, has had a lot of stuff going on lately.  First off, they've added a killer poll, so be sure to vote (this week it's Rebels Vs. Imperials).  They've also added a new link button, so if you own a site, and like FC Outpost, be sure to use the new button to link.  Big thanks to our very own Kedri for all the amazing (as usual) graphics work.<br><br>
Finally, as always, they've got the low-down on all the latest happenings in the Force Commander community, so stop by and pay them a visit.
