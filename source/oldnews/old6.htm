We have been falling behind on our coverage of editing groups, so to catch
up, here are all the newly started, or previously unlisted, editing groups.  They
look very promising, and I wish luck to all those involved.  Remember, a lot of editing
groups are looking for new editors, so if you find one that looks interesting, make sure
to apply.
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.scv.net/~kya/Jk/jediknight.html" target="_top">KYA</a> - 
Gameplay, a major factor in Levels, is what KYA wanted to focus on. 
Detailed Levels and Good Mods have already been created before, but, KYA 
wants to be the first to make good-looking levels with high gameplay. 
<li><a href="http://members.xoom.com/NCybertron" target="_top">New Cybertron</a>, The Transformer Project -  
We are trying to make Transformers in JK. anyone can help if they want to. We need people that can edit weapons, levels and 3do's.
<li><a href="http://jedikniggits.ml.org/core" target="_top">C.O.R.E. Design Team</a> - Great looking page, 
this group is working on Multi-player levels for JK/MotS.
<li><a href="http://www.geocities.com/timessquare/maze/4984/index.html" target="_top">Rancor Productions</a> -
This group is just starting out so needs talented editors to join.  As of now the project in progress is a Spider Man TC.
<li><a href="http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Dunes/5640/" target="_top">Knights of the Jedi Editing Team</a> -
I just found this group browsing around, they managed to get a hold of Kaminari, who is an excellent level editor, so I wanted
to give them a mention.
</ul>
Good luck to these groups, and remember, if you'd like to be mentioned in the news
and added to our Editing Groups page, send me an <a href="mailto:lozier@bigfoot.com">

anyway. Sorry Brian, I tried. :)

Stitches Are Bad
</strong><small>- <a href="mailto:lozier@bigfoot.com">Brian</a></small></span></font>


<blockquote>
<font color="white" size="2"><font face="verdana"><span style="font-family: verdana">
Actually, <i>stitches</i> are probably good, but the process of getting them put IN is
no fun at all.  Want to hear a story?  Well if not please stop reading.
<br><br>
I haven't skateboarded in 4 years -- I felt I wasn't getting enough exercise, so I decided
to go buy a skateboard and have some fun.  Saturday, I did that -- skated for about 8 hours
Saturday, watched a competition, etc.  (I actually pulled some cool tricks too, for someone
who hasn't done it in four years!)
<br><br>
Well last night, after dark, I decided to go skate again, so I did just that, I boarded down
the street to this cool parking lot that has good pavement, skated for like an hour, got tired
and decided to make my way back home.  On the way home I stopped by the Post Office to check
my mail, got a few things, and was out the door skating home when a Frog jumped out in front
of me.  I couldn't stop in time, so rather than kill the poor thing, I hurled myself OFF the
board, landed on my hand, then shoulder, and did a roll.  I stood up, went to brush my shirt
off and this big stream of blood flew out of my hand.
<br><br>
I got cut on my right hand between my pinky and ring finger -- rocks/dirt/whatever was all
stuck in there crazy, so I walked home, and proceeded to scrub it out.  After about 20 mins
of that, it was pretty clean, so I decided I needed some Hydrogen Peroxide to make sure it
didn't get infected.
<br><br>
By this time, it was about 9:45 PM, so the only place open is what's called the
Shoppette, just a small convenience type story.  They were out.  So, seeing as how I'm
in the military, I get "free" health care.  So, I drove over to the emergency room, and
asked for some hydrogen peroxide to clean out this cut.  The doctor looked at it, and
decided I needed stitches.  Ouch.
<br><br>
Got two, and can't move my right hand (you don't even want to know how long it took to type
this story).  It's really not that bad, but I just wanted to share it with someone.
<br><br>
Moral of the story?  Either don't stop for frogs or invest in a good pair of leather skating
gloves!  I will personally hook up with the gloves because I love animals.
<br><br>
-Loz Out.

editing group that has a LOT of potential.  I've had the pleasure of reading their story, as well as previewing a few
of their levels.  Let me tell you the architecture and lighting are superb, and that along with this unique (and very
well written) storyline should prove to be a winning combination.  Here is what Yuri (the Grinch), project leader, had
to say:
<blockquote><font color="silver">
Past history and present action are one...The force surrounds all time...All doing." - Bodo-Bass an ancient Jedi Master. Holocron Editing is working on what we feel is a true sequel to JK and MOTS and one of the strongest conversion stories out there. We're working on a large project and are always on the look out for new members. We are working on new force powers, weapons and cogs. We also have several new 3d0s in the works. If you're keen to work with a progressive, ambitious and dedicated group then give us a look.

As always, if your editing group wishes to be added to our editing group list (see the sidebar) just send me an email -- I can't
promise it will get in right away, but it will get in.  (Thanks for being patient Yuri)
