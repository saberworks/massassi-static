 We at The Massassi Temple are proud to announce that we will be moving to our new server and domain tomorrow.  What does this mean to you? It means increased server performance (no more FTP and downloading problems), a shorter name to type in (<a href="http://www.massassi.net" target="_top">http://www.massassi.net</a>), an expanded files section (so you don't have to go to numerous sites to get the files you need), and finally, we are offering hosting.  We have two sites already hosted, and you check them out tomorrow.  There will be a notice posted here when the site goes live.

  Started the news pretty late today, I guess I need sleep too, sometimes!  A lot of things going on, we have moved almost all the existing sections over to our new server - Thanks a ton to Slug for uploading a ton of sections as well as over 100 megs of levels.

  <BR><BR>

  Other than that, I have to do the editors and utilities sections, as well as our MotS and Obi-Wan info sections.  Do these sound new?  Well, they are, we're trying to make Massassi a very complete Jedi Knight site, which includes having the basics down too.  We are also (finally) working on a complete files section, so people don't have to go to a ton of different sites to get files.

   ALLIANCE_Posse emailed us a huge text file that has short reviews of about 75 levels.  You can grab this bad boy <a href="addon_reviews.txt">right here</a>.  The best way to get it is probably to right-click then press "save as" and then open it with notepad.  Here is the email so you know exactly what you're downloading.

   <blockquote><font color="gray">

   Hello.  I am ALLIANCE_Posse, and I have recently made a HUGE list of addon level reviews for the common public.  It's in notepad form, and lists roughly 75 levels and a short paragraph or so on each one, along

   with a rating.  At the bottom is a list of my favorite addons.  And a way to submit some to me so I can review them.  I hope to release an update to this every two weeks.  I made this in hopes of helping people find the good quality levels out there to download.</font></blockquote>

        Right off the bat: Joke is a new 3do editor (announced a few days ago) being programmed by <a href="http://outpostd34.com/droid/start/index.html" target="_top">droid</a> (that's a link to his site).  Anyway, he updated his <a href="http://outpostd34.com/droid/plan/index.html" target="_top">.plan</a> with a ton of information on the product.  Here is a snippet, visit the plan file for more info.

        <blockquote><font color="gray">

        I thought I´d share with you what Joke can do right now. Create your basic primitives (cube, plane, sphere, tube) all with options on how they should be created. Vertex inserter (between two vertices). Surface splitter (or cleave if you want, somewhat diffrent from Jed´s tho). Surface extruder, not much to say about it. Plus some less intresting commands (invert face, etc.). Multi Selection, there isen´t really a single selection mode... Better transformation tools than F3DO. Supported import formats: .md2 (quake2), .obj, .cob. More to come, of course.

         <a href="mailto:johnred@sk.sympatico.ca">Mobius</a> sent us a couple of screenshots of his new level, Galaxy in Fear, as well as some of the background story.

         <blockquote><font color="gray">

         The level I'm making is called Galaxy in Fear. There has been a great distubance in the Force, both the New Republic and the Empire stand a chance of being completely destroyed. That's all I'm going to say, at least for now; I'm not going to ruin the plot for you! One thing that I'm trying to focus on is making the level revolve around the story, not vise-versa. Here's a couple pics of my upcoming level. They're not as good as say Drazen Isle, or Warzone, or the Saberworks stuff. But I still have a lot of geometry editing and tweaking to do, so it'll look better as time progresses. I should have a webpage up soon.

                   <a href="http://www.jedilegacy.net" target="_top">Jedi Legacy</a> has released their new saber mod, which includes a bunch of new keys, among other things.  Here is the description from their page:

                   <blockquote><font color="gray">

                   YES! Finally, after approximately 5 weeks of intensive work by a team of no less than 13 different editors, my saber mod project, derivatively and PR-like named Legacy of the Jedi, is now available for download and mad playing fun! So, just what will you get out of this mod? New saber moves, the ability to use single and double-bladed saber with different moves, a grappling hook, no physical damage, a new, totally kick-ass force push, and much much more! This labor of love will surely prove a favorite (and if it doesn't, I don't care, since I love it!). So, without further ado, I present to you Legacy of the Jedi, a fine Jedi Legacy/SHAFT joint production!

                      Ah, more fine Massassi news... We will be having a level contest, with the best, deserving levels being placed in an official Massassi Level Pack, to be displayed on our main page forever (or at least until we decide to remove it).  All submissions will be judged by our staff members, as well as a few other prominent members of the JK community (to be announced later).  The rules are as follows:<br><br>

                      <ol><font color="gray">

                      <li>Jedi Knight Multiplayer Level (NOT MotS).

                      <li>No illegal copyrighted material (if you have questions on this, <a href="mailto:brian@vampirecentral.com">e-mail me</a>).

                      <li>All submissions must have a valid readme file.

                      <li>Level authors give Massassi permission to release their level in our pack, and to keep it there (IE: we will not remove a level if later on down the line, you decide you don't want it there).

                      <li>No old levels - if it's already been released, it doesn't count.

                      <li>No revamped JK MP/SP levels - IE: we don't want Canyon Oasis mods!

                      <li>All submissions must be receieved no later than September 15, 1999 (that's right, you have just over a month to get these things done).

                      </font></ol><br>

                      This weekend I will post a page detailing how to submit levels for the pack, but the above rules should be enough to get you started.  Below are a few of the things being judged.<br><br>

                      <ul><font color="gray">

                      <li>Architecture - there is no reason at this stage to submit levels with overly boxy or simple architecture.  Please take time with it and make it appealing!

                      <li>Texturing - misaligned textures are totally unacceptable.  Please make sure all your textures make sense for the area/theme/etc and are aligned properly.

                      <li>Lighting - Not one of my personal favorites to do, but lighting is important.  Make sure it's not too dark to play in (as is the case with many levels).  Most of the time this is because of variances in monitors and graphics cards, so try using the JK Beta Testing group to make sure you are good to go.

                      <li>Cogs - Cogs are not necessary, but if you do implement them, make sure you have used high qualiy, non-lagging cogs (IE: client/server, if possible).

                      <li>Framerate - This is very important, your level must be able to run well on a wide variey of machines, please, don't submit levels that only run well on a powerhouse computer.

                      </font></ul><br>

                      That's it for now, more info on the way this weekend.

                      Okay, here's some more site news.  As most of you know, we are moving to the new server this weekend (read story below if you don't know this).  Also this weekend, some other stuff will be happening.  6000 Block will be released (thanks Hideki for the cogs!), and a couple of awesome hosted sites will debut.  That's right, hosted sites.  With the new domain comes the possibility of hosting high-quality JK/Obi-Wan/Star Wars sites.  Here is a rundown of the two so far:<BR>

                      <br><ul>

                      <li><b>Millennium</b>: A cog site run by Hideki, creator of the Lightstaff and Enhancement pack (as well as other things, I'm sure).  The site focuses on cog help (the long awaited cog tutorials that Massassi was never able to pull off, as well as message boards and downloads).</li>

                      <li><b>JK Beta Testing Group</b>: One of my personal favorites - everyone should use these guys.  Basically, you submit a level, and within a week or so you get it beta-tested on a wide variety of machines by a wide variety of people, and they all send in very helpful reports.  Every level author should use these guys, period.</li>

                      </ul><br>

                      There is a ton of info on hosting @ the new Massassi that you can read when the site goes live, please hold all applications until then.

                      </span></font></dd></dl>

                      Massassi Level Review Section

                      </strong><small>- <a href="mailto:brian@vampirecentral.com">Brian</a></small></span></font></dt>

                      

                      <dd><font color="white" size="2" face="verdana"><span style="font-family: verdana">

                      An idea that I've been throwing around since we started posting levels is a review section (or even a hosted review site).  Basically, every level that comes in will be reviewed *before* it is posted.  That way, people have the option of reading the review before they download it.  The reviews will be linked off the main page, as well as each individual level page.<br><Br>

                      What I'd like now is to put together a list of people that would like to be <i>dedicated</i> reviewers for the site.  This would mean reviewing levels <b>promptly</b> as they are sent in.  It would be a daily thing (which is why I want to get together a bunch of people for this) that does take time.

                      <br><br>

                      The review section/site will be fully scripted, meaning, when you type up a review (in a specified format, to be discussed later), each paragraph goes into a web form, and, when submitted, the review gets posted, the level gets posted, and the news gets updated.  This takes a lot of the burden off the more menial stuff like updating web sites and such.

                      <br><BR>

                      Anyway, if you are interested, please drop me an <a href="mailto:brian@vampirecentral.com">e-mail</a> with your qualifications, interests (regarding the site), how often you will be able to review levels, and whether you just want to be a reviewer or actually work on the site design/webmaster stuff.  Actual reviewers need no HTML experience (the beauty of CGI scripting), but other positions will need it.

                      Our levels section won't be updated till Saturday.  That is when we move to our new server.  Right now, we are working on uploading all the levels to the new server, and pointing all the links to the new ftp.  Sorry for the inconvenience.<BR><BR>

                      In case you have no idea what that means, Massassi is moving to a new server this weekend - it should solve all the download problems and allow us to offer features never before seen on this site.  Stay tuned for some exciting stuff in the future!
