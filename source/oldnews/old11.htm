                       <a href="http://www.jediknight.net/" target="_top">JediKnight.net</a> announced two different plugins today, I hardly ever use them, which is one of the reasons they never get announced here, but one of these sounds pretty cool (Hey Slug, want to do a plugins review type page here like you have on <a href="http://www.jediknight.net/darkfall/" target="_top">Darkness Falls</a>?).  The first one is called Cleave2VX (cleave 2 vertices, I suppose), which helps you cleave between multiselected vertices on a surface.  Apparently there has been problems with Jed's "cleave to vertex" function (I've never had it, just align the grid to the vertex and it will work, but oh well).  The second one seems a bit better, called Go Rotate.  Here's the description from their page:
                       <blockquote><font color="gray">
                       After seeing the prequel trailer I was just dying to try and make some of those building on Corsucant but the domes and columns. Fear not! This plugin makes them with no trouble. Actually, it is just a ripoff of dr0id's "FreeSector" plugin. You enter some points on the XZ plane and it will rotate them about the Z axis to create circular sectors. It also has a ARC function for doing those domes!
                       </font></blockquote>
                       Both plugins are by Ugg_Boot, and can be found at his site, <a href="http://www.rpi.net.au/~cu/main.html" target="_top">The Imperial Detention Center</a>.

                         The staff here at Massassi are feeling a little overburdened with the levels section. The reason we started it was to join with the review board.  In theory, people were supposed to download and play a level, then post on the review board.  The review board was used at first, which was cool, and there have been one or two decent threads, but it's underused, doesn't provide much feedback for level authors, and is kind of pointless now.  So, are we going to drop the levels section and review board?  Well we are thinking about it.  Slug and I have discussed creating pages for Massassi Staff "recommended" levels/mods.  That way, people wouldn't come to Massassi expecting high quality stuff to be posted here, and then download something not even worth the space on the server.<br><BR>
                         Farrax, Slug and I have put a lot of work into the levels section (getting the scripts up and running, getting the design down, getting 25 megs or so of levels posted, etc), and we don't really want to let it go to waste.  However, it's a lot easier for us to drop the work we've already done in favor of providing something useful for the community.  So, please drop by the <a href="http://massassi.jedinights.com/discussion/">Discussion Board</a> and let us know what you think of this idea.  We will continue to post new levels as they come to us, but we will not archive them on a permanent page.  If they are incredible levels, a permanent page will be created where people can read about the level/mod/patch, see some screenshots, and download it.  This would take a huge burden off the staff, as well as make the levels section a more useful place for people to find great levels.

                                      I added a hit stat thing to the page, the link is right above the current news.  It started today, so of course our 100,000+ hits won't show up, but it ought to be interesting to see how many hits per day, weekend, hour, etc, we get.  Just click on the button and you can see the stats.<br><br>
                                      I have a CDC (Career Development Course) test on Monday - it's an Air Force test.  If I pass, my skill level gets upgraded, if I fail, I may be ejected from the Air Force.  I don't want to fail, and I have yet to study, so you won't be seeing much of me till next week.  Unfortunately, after that I will be taking a 3-4 week hiatus for a badly needed vacation.  I will be going to beautiful Washington State to be with family and friends.  I will make a few updates between now and then, but I most likely won't be able to update from there (unless someone wants to donte a laptop, just <a href="mailto:lozier@bigfoot.com">email me</a>).

                                            <blockquote><font color="gray">

                                            These plugins can be found on the Darkjedi.com <a href="http://www.darkjedi.com/jedplugin.htm" target="_top">Plugins Page</a>, under the name ThingPack.zip.  Thanks to UGG_BOOT for creating these plugins.

                                             This HAS been announced all over the JK sites, however, I think LSP deserves more recognition than they have recieved so far.  Basically, <a href="http://www.netsquads.com/lsp/" target="_top">Last Stand Productions</a> has released a <a href="ftp://ftp.jedinights.com/massassi/levels/dfaguns.zip">weapons mod</a>.  This weapons mod changes 3 weapons in JK.  The weapons pack is simply a preview of what is to come from the rest of their mod.  They are working on a conversion that will have 3 Single Player levels, new ships (screenshots posted at their site, and the Alpha Squadron preview listed below), and more weapons (I think).  This is a great weapons patch, and I recommend it to everyone.  Now, here are the descriptions of the 3 new weapons included.
                                             <blockquote><font color="gray">
                                             <b>Weapon 2: Bartioli 5.56mm (.22) m2025 Pistol.</b><br>
                                             The Bartioli is the standard sidearm for all U.N. personnel. It is a recoil-operated, magazine-fed, semi-automatic double action pistol that uses the standard NATO 5.56mm (.223 long rifle) round. The clip carries 7 rounds.<br><br>
                                             <b>Weapon 3: M-32 5.56mm (.22) m2025 OICW (Assault Rifle).</b><br>
                                             The M-32 is the standard rifle for all U.N. ground forces. It is an air-cooled, gas-operated, magazine-fed, shoulder - or hip - fired weapon that uses the standard NATO 5.56mm (.223 long rifle) round. The magazine clip carrys 30 rounds. The most common attachment is the M-90, a compact, magazine-loading, semi automatic grenade launcher that uses a 20mm HE  round.<BR><BR>
                                             <b>Weapon 5: Joint Service Combat Shotgun (12 Gauge).</b><br>
                                             The JSCS is 12 Gauge shotgun is the standard weapon for all U.N. security forces. It's the perfect weapon where range is limited - like on a ship. Ineffective at long range, this weapon is best used to clear several targets at once at medium range. It uses 00
                                             Buckshot.</font></blockquote>
                                             Hope this helps your decision to download.  I must say these weapons are way more fun than the ones included in JK.

                                              <blockquote><font color="gray">
                                              This project is based on a fairly simple idea: dealings with pre/beta-releases of Jedi Knight (and MOTS of course) Projects. Don't expect much activity for a little while, it'll take a while to stock up the previews. Here authors of JK projects can create previews of their projects or have previews made by our staff.</font></blockquote>
                                              Also, they are looking for some staff to help them out, if you're interested, check out their main page.<br><br>

It's a pretty hefty file, but from what I've heard, it's well worth it.  Basically it is a cog-based cutscene showing off parts of the level as well as the story.  The actual level is about 90% done, so be expecting that pretty soon.  This mod has a lot of promise, be sure to check it out.

This program has been eagerly awaited by MotS editors, and you won't be disappointed. This program allows you to easily create new Character Classes in Mysteries of the Sith. A great tutorial written by <a href="mailto:ev@wave.co.nz">EvanC</a> is included as a help file within the program, so be sure to refer to that when you start. Class Creator has a <a href="http://www.cues.com/creator/">homepage</a> where you can give feedback via a form, be sure to leave your impressions of the program!
                                                                      <br><BR>

                                                                      <BR><BR>

                                                                      <blockquote>

Download the <a href="http://scripts.cues.com/creator/download.asp?ftp://ftp.jedinights.com/massassi/ClassCreator.zip">Class Creator</a> (219k) progam only file, extract the files to a directory using <a href="http://www.winzip.com">Winzip</a> or the like, but before you actually run the program, run version.exe. This handy little program will show you whether you have the required dll files. Green means you have them, red means you do not. If anything OTHER THAN <i>msvbvm50.dll </i>and <i>comcat.dll</i> are RED, then you need to download the following file. If only those are red (or if they are green), you are ready to go!</font>

As soon as the rest of the staff finishes testing it, I will implement it into the site, should be by tomorrow.  What does this mean to you?  It means that you can send in your mods/levels/patches for posting!  We will keep a permanent archive of them, and hopefully this will encourage a renewed interest in our Review Board.  So, if you have a mod you are proud of, old or new, be sure to send it in.

Thanks to <a href="mailto:ct_ramen@uclink4.berkeley.edu">Captain Ramen</a>, I got a chance to beta-test the mod.  I tell you this, watch out Quake 2, because this shotgun rocks!  Blowing innocent civilians through windows is fun as hell, but its even more satisfying to see the spray of blood as your bullets hit.  The automatic rifle kicks too, especially the grenade launcher that is attached.  Anyway, be sure to download this biatch as soon as it gets released.  Gotta go play some more...

The reason is that my internet access is so slow it takes me upwards of 5 minutes to upload the script and the htm files, and with trying to trouble-shoot, I usually upload about 50 times before I get it working perfectly.  Needless to say, I don't have the patience for this.  Hopefully tomorrow my access speed will be back up to normal.

Then a few days ago EvanC came to me with a great idea for a better way to do it. So, we did it. Then I decided I should write up a tutorial for it. It's not the best thing in the world, and you might have to tweak it a little for your needs, but you can <a href="fog/fog.htm">read it</a> and try it out.

It is based on a trilogy of upcoming levels.  The thing that made this stand out to me is the storyline:
                                                                                                  <blockquote><font color="gray">
                                                                                                  I just launched a page dedicated to my 3 level SP saga
                                                                                                  for JK called Mechanics of the Force. I'm hoping to try and break a little, teeny bit of new ground. You play a protocol droid whose memory has been erased and throughout the level, your past unfolds. I've done some massive cogging and there are already several cutscenes.

SO, if you make a mistake in your html, you must download it with an ftp program and fix the mistakes manually.
