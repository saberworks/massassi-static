<b>Description:</b>
<font color="gray">You may remember a version of Ship Morph 1.1 a couple of weeks back, so welcome to its hugely popular sequel now called - Smorph. This modification allows you to <b>become</b> a TIE Bomber or The Crow. This is a huge update and now includes a grappling hook, a powerful vertical shotgun and The Conc Rifle 10K.<br>
Ships have a self-destruct mechanism and include varied weaponry (The TIE Bomber now has rear turrets to fire at enemies behind it and The Crow carries a charging blast cannon as well as a molten shrapnel launcher!).<br>
Ships now also have sounds and the scaling has been vastly improved, to allow much better air battles and aiming.<br>
The most fun you can have in one game! Don't believe me? See for yourself!</font>

<blockquote><font color="gray">
This program will let you open/save particles. It will also allow you to import/export vertices from Jed as particles and edit the particles attributes. Nothing more, nothing less.

As dr0id mentioned in his email, particles weren't used very much in JK, but they can be used to make some cool effects (remember the floating death star diagram in level 1 of Dark Forces?).

<font color="gray">This mod is a weapons pack that makes weapons more powerful and generally better compared to the regular game. The new weapons will create more fast and furious gameplay with much excitment.  The only weapons I didn't add were the lightsaber, fists, sequencer charges, and thermal detonaters.  These weapons are excellent (except fists) in and among themselves. I hope you enjoy!</font>

The program accepts most image types, but I would reccomend using BMP or JPG/JPEG just in case.  I'll take any shots you have, plain and doctored, from JK and MotS.  I'll be accepting entries until the end of January, but I'll keep it open if I keep getting alot of submissions.  Don't forget to include your name; gotta give credit

We are very aware that the server has been very slow during peak times.  This is because we've outgrown our dedicated server.  We are working with UGO to offload our forums onto another server, which will free this one up to simple serve pages and files.  This Tuesday, we will find out for sure exactly what's going on.  This problem has not only caused slowdowns in viewing pages and forums, but also in downloads (time out errors).  Please bear with us, we are working as fast as we possibly can.

<dd><font color="white" size="2" face="verdana"><span style="font-family: verdana">
This came down the wire earlier today from <a href="mailto:"eggenletus@yahoo.com">Fardreamer</a> over at <a
href="http://www.outpostd34.com/sandcrawler"
target="_top">Sandcrawler Productions</a>:

<blockquote><font color="gray">Many people are wondering what's going on with <a
href="http://www.outpostd34.com/sandcrawler"
target="_top">Sandcrawler Productions's</a> lightsaber
mod, Art of the Lightsaber. We've been working on it
for months now, perfecting it, adding features and
increasing playability according to gamers' demands.
Approximately one week ago we completed the mod.
However, on the last minute a peculiar, inexplicable
and apparently unsolvable bug popped up - and that is
why it wasn't released as promised on Christmas Eve.
In addition to this, the server move of Outpost D-34
brought with it innumerable problems with the site
which needed immediate attention.<br><br>
We would like to take this opportunity to apologize
to all gamers who are disappointed with us; we are
doing our best to complete the mod and get it released
as soon as possible. It has already been blown way out
of proportion (originally intended as a demo for
<i>The Face of Death</i>), and has forced us to set
aside our more important projects. Rest assured that
the moment we're done, it'll be available for download
from every major news site.</font></blockquote>

You don't bind them to hotkeys because they modify the player's fighting ability so don't think they are force powers. There are 12 stats in all and are divided into three sections.<br><br>
The first four skills are the Basic Skills in which a player can increase his Strength (adds to melee weapons power), Increase his Vitality (adds more Health units), incease his agility (makes him move faster), and the last one is Endurance (how much damage the player takes.)

<font color="gray">Well, this mod basically enhances guns (makes them more lethal). In this version there's a new rail detonator, but since the repeater gun that appeared in the first Beta sucked out loud, I'm going to replace it with something. Also Benny Tsai's Gunblade found its way out from this Beta (if I can't find out why it sometimes screws key's up, I'm gonna leave it outta Kaboom Final).</font>

Last month was our biggest month ever, with 1.2 million hits network-wide (excluding Watto's Junkyard - and Massassi has the VAST majority of these hits).  Unfortunately, with this staggering amount of hits, we are already overloading our new dedicated server!  This means that during peak times, access, especially to the forums, can slow down a bit.  I am working with UGO to get a server for our forums (which will take the majority of the load off this server).  Hopefully we can get something worked out within a week or so.<br><br>
Again, my thanks goes out to all of those that continually visit this site.  Without you, we would be nothing.  Also thanks to <a href="http://www.darkjedi.com/" target="_top">The Code Alliance</a>: without them, there would be no JK editing community, and therefore, no Massassi.
