Jedi Finger Updates

<dd><font color="white" size="2" face="verdana"><span style="font-family: verdana">

If you've never visited <a href="http://www.jediknight.net" target="_top">JediKnight.net</a>'s

finger service, <a href="http://www.jediknight.net/finger/finger.cgi" target="_top">

Jedi Finger</a>, you may be missing out on a lot.  It's a great place to get up-to-date news

and information related to JK.  Here's a few of the good ones from the past weekend.

<br><br>

Nijaan - on the closure of <a href="http://spaceport.jedinights.com" target="_top">Spaceport</a>:

<blockquote><font color="gray">

Well, some of you may have noticed that I closed down the site for a while... <br><br>

Why? <br><br>

Well after Neb left everything obviously slowed down, and Inph can't really work on the site till may... this leaves me, I don't have a lotta time on my hands so I decided to close down the site for a small period of time.... <br><br>

But this down time is not perminent. I plan on re launching the site in a month or 2, at the latest, the re-launch would be in early Jan. <br><br>

Another format? <br><br>

Yes I am gonna make a new format for one reason, every one I have came up with so far as sucked big time. so what am I gonna do? I am going the distance, going for speed, ok well just for something simple that is well organized fast loading and works for all ressolutions. I must also mention my good friends from the Cantina Cloud who gave me advice on the ressolution wether they know it or not. <br><br>

What about reviews? <br><br>

No more reviews. They are a pain so instead of that I am aiming for articles. I mean there will be a major inflow of articles, another reason the relaunch won't be for a wile, because I want to come out with a bang. so I will need article writers, and a few have already started working on some material. I will be writing a lot of material for this as well... and a few on going sections from me(and hopefully some other people will have sections for the new site as well) that will tackle subjects that has to deal with the Star Wars(not only the games) in general. <br><br>

Anything new? <br><br>

Well yes other than what I have just posted up top I have plenty of ideas for new features which I can't say now cus I need to see if I can get support from variose people on one of the features. I will also have an art gallery collecting any of the proffesion conceptual art(sw related) I can find, IE RM, Dave Dorman, and lucasarts. which I do believe will be cool. And if you people are artistic please send me your work I promise it will be posted. <br><bR>

Thats all for now, when I think of something, I will give ya peoples another update.

Dark Knight - Class Creator progress:

<blockquote><font color="gray">

Ok. Didn't spend all that much time on CC this afternoon (worked on it into the wee hours of the morning though). Just did some minor tweaks on the program to get some things corrected. Tried my hand at making a context sensitive help file for CC - didn't work out too well. Hopefully Rishka will be able to figure out that damn program. On schedule for tomorrow is to start creating some documentation and work more on .per importing. Then whip up a website on Tuesday and hopefully release Wednesday. Didn't get a chance to put up the DLL stuff, that'll come tomorrow.

</font></blockquote>

Alexei Novikov - Status of JED:

<blockquote><font color="gray">

JED is almost ready. But there are still a few things that need to be taken care of, so I doubt it'll be out this weekend, rather the beginning of next week (tuesday?).

<br><br>

I was planning to add a capability for plug-ins to actually display some things in JED window (giving a way to .KEY editor, for example), but there are some complications with that. I'll need to think some more about it.

We've expanded our staff and are no longer accepting applications.  Thanks to everyone who has applied.

I will announce the names/positions of the new staff members once we get them informed on how page updates

work, etc.<br><br>

Other site related news: We are working on a levels page to keep an archive of the levels we post.  This should

be done today or tomorrow.  Please, though, if you are submitting a level to us, let us know whether its SP or MP,

JK or MOTS, KFY or CTF, etc, etc, etc.  We need this information so we can classify and post each level without

having to play it.

<br><br>

Also you may notice that the news posts look a little different.  It saves space, and is just as easy 

to read, so we will go with it.  Thanks goes to Farrax, of <http://www.jediknight.net/review/" target="_top">

Hyperview</a>, for helping me out with the html for that.  We've also worked out a cool deal with Farrax.

Once we get the levels page up and running, Farrax will be helping out with posting levels -- so when

you submit your level to Hyperview, it will automatically get posted on Massassi as well.

<br><BR>

I'm really not happy with our little link-to button.  If anyone feels like making a new one for us, please

do!  Remember to make it the same size (as in pixel width/height).

<br><Br>

A few more things:  I WILL finish that templates tutorial if its the last thing I do!  Also,

Evan is working on re-wording one section of his rivers tutorial.  Once that is finished, it

will get posted.<br><br>

On levels and patches:  If you submit <i>anything</i> to us, and we haven't posted it within

one week, <i>please</i> re-submit it!  We strive to get to everything, but sometimes

things get lost in the shuffle.

<br><br>

Feedback Wanted!  How do you feel about our expanded coverage of everything JK-related?  I have been enjoying

posting (as you can see, I don't post much, if at all, on weekends), and I'd like to hear your feedback.

Feel free to send me an <a href="mailto:lozier@bigfoot.com">email</a>, or post a message on the 

discussion board.

Added some features, squashed a few bugs and generally spent most of the evening working on the program. Still mulling over whether or not to write a .per importing feature.

Being unhappy with the type of news posted on the other JK news sites lately, I have

decided to try expanding our coverage.  Don't worry, we won't get non-JK/editing related,

at least until another cool editable Star Wars game comes out.  So, if you have a review site,

editing group, etc, and want us to post your news, be sure to send an email to the submit news

link.  Remember, we don't take skins (yet), and won't post "help wanted" or "classified" type

ads.  Also feel free to leave feedback on the discussion board.

<br><br>

One more thing, if anyone has experience in web based java-chat, and knows a good program to use for

it, let me know.  I'd really like to get a web based IRC client for our chat channel.

Water Tutorial Updated

</strong><small>- <a href="mailto:lozier@bigfoot.com">Brian</a></small></span></font>



<blockquote>

<font color="white" size="2" face="verdana"><span style="font-family: verdana">

I have begun the long process of updating our old tutorials to reflect newer versions

of JED, newer techniques, and updated information.  In the process, they will be converted

to the new white format as well (its easier on my eyes).  I started with the

<a href="http://massassi.jedinights.com/water/tutor.htm" target="frame2">Water Tutorial</a>.

If you already know how to make water, don't even waste your time.  I just wanted to let everyone

know that I am working on this aspect of the site.  I will continue to announce as each

tutorial is updated.  As always, if you feel something should be added or taken away from

any tutorial, just email me and I will look into it.

<br><br>

On a side note, the update version of the water tutorial mentions a rivers tutorial -- its not posted

yet, but will be soon.  I just didn't want to have to re-update the page when the rivers tutorial gets

posted.

Beta Templates Tutorial

<font color="white" size="2" face="verdana"><span style="font-family: verdana">

Since I'm not too familiar with the ins and outs of creating templates (I can do them,

I'm just no expert), I wanted to let everyone read over my templates tutorial before I

actually posted it.  Its on the Discussion Board.  Note: There are no images yet, 

I'm trying to get things right first, so be sure to leave input.

Interesting Site

Not totally editing related, but I was browsing some Star Wars sites and happened upon

a really cool reference site.  It has tons of info on a LOT of Star Wars characters,

even some audio and video.  If you need some ideas for main/supporting characters in

your story lines, or are looking for some more skins to work on, be sure to check it out.

The site is: <a href="http://www.dunesea.com/delta/frames.html" target="_top">Delta

I don't know whats up with this, but apparently the

closed its doors for a while.  You can read Nij's small post by clicking the above

Editing Groups Section

<blockquote>

<font color="white" size="2" face="verdana"><span style="font-family: verdana">

I was going through the links on our editing groups page, and about half of them

were dead.  So, I have decided to take that page down.  If your editing group

wants to be mentioned in the news, update your site with some screenshots or 

information, and then drop us an email.

<br><br>

Here is our new policy on editing groups:  We will NOT post classifieds/help wanted info.

This is due to the incredible amount of TC's that have been started and never finished.  If

you need members for your groups, feel free to use the Discussion Board.  However, we WILL

post news whenver you update your page with new screenshots or information on your project (NOT

new members, web page redesigns, etc).  So, if your group wants to stay in the news, be sure

to email us whenever you update your page!

Personal Rant

<a href="http://www.jediknight.net/" target="_top">JediKnight.net</a> posted a news post

by Jepmaan relating to a skinning course.  While I'm not opposed to the idea, I am disappointed

that Jepmaan decided to post us as potential sponsors without even talking to me about it.

If you or your editing group needs/wants Massassi as a sponsor, PLEASE ask me.

Help Wanted

</strong><small>- <a href="mailto:lozier@bigfoot.com">Brian</a></small></span></font>



<blockquote>

<font color="white" size="2" face="verdana"><span style="font-family: verdana">

Once again we are asking for one or two people to help us out with the site.  I would

like to have one person for mat files and one person for 3do's.  Slug and the rest of the

gang have been doing well, but it's just too much work considering all our other side projects.

<br><br>

Basically, when a new mat or 3do comes in, you would have to post it on the news, update the 3do/mat

page, and upload the file to the server.  All html for Massassi is done by hand in WORDPAD, so if you

don't know how to hand code html, please do not apply (graphical editors bite).  If interested,

please <a href="mailto:lozier@bigfoot.com">Email Me</a>.
