<font color="white" size="2"><font face="verdana"><span style="font-family: verdana">
As you can probably tell, I had the itch to write today, so I've worked up two
more articles.  These two discuss the basics of Jedi Knight level editing, so
if you already are an accomplished editor, there is no need to read them.
<br><br>
If you are wondering what Jedi Knight levels are made up of, and want some
general knowledge, please take a look.  I think that if this kind of info was
out there when I first started, my life would have been a lot easier.
<blockquote>
<a href="basic/basic1.htm" target="frame2">Lesson 1</a> deals with the
building blocks of Jedi Knight levels.  Sectors, surfaces, vertices, textures,
3do's, sprites, cogs, etc.  It gives very basic definitions, plus background
information.
<br><br>
<a href="basic/basic2.htm" target="frame2">Lesson 2</a> deals with
sector and surface flags, lighting, adjoining, and the rules regarding
sectors.
</blockquote>
Both articles relate to BOTH editors, Jed and JkEdit, so if you are a beginner,
or are looking into creating your own level for the first time, check these out.

<a href="mailto:glitch@digisys.net">8t88</a>, my co-webmaster here at Massassi,
is about to unveil a new level review site.  Called <i>The Vault</i>, this site
will not only have level reviews, but also previews of upcoming levels from
well known level authors, and interviews with the various editing teams
scattered around the internet.  We need for all you level authors to submit
levels to either <a href="mailto:glitch@digisys.net">8t88</a> or 
<a href="mailto:lozier@bigfoot.com">myself</a>.  There are a few
questions that MUST be answered in the email before we post a review:
<ul>
<li>If this is a JK level, is there anything from MotS (textures, 3do's, cogs, etc)
in this level?<BR>
<font color="red"><small><i>Note: Answering YES to this question will
result in your level being rejected</i></small></font>
<li>Have you included ALL information required in a Readme file?<BR>
<font color="red"><small><i>Note: Answering NO to this question will
result in your level being rejected</i></small></font>
</ul>
With this site, we are striving to become THE place you go for level reviews.
The only way to start is by getting levels submitted BY you level authors.
Expect a release sometime this week with 2 reviews, an interview with the folks
over at <a href="http://www.votj.com/vortex" target="_top">Vortex To Darkness</a>,
and a preview of an upcoming MotS Single Player level.

Version 1.04 of JkEdit has some new features:
<ul>

</ul>
Version 1.04 of JkEdit has a few bug fixes:
<ul>
<li>A crash could occur after extruding a surface

<li>The initial values in the Texture Coordinate dialog were wrong
<li>The file sphere.x was missing
</ul>

Well, 8t88 has been keeping this one from me for a while, but here is a small
<a href="screen.txt">text file</a> that explains how to edit BM's (those are the background screens
that show when you access menu's in JK).  Thanks to <a href="mailto:pmanuel@worldnet.att.net">

#massassi Chat Channel

<font color="white" size="2"><font face="verdana"><span style="font-family: verdana">
The channel has been pretty full lately, but it seems that we don't get many new
faces.  I think it's becuase if you don't happen to catch the news on the day I announce
it, you miss out.  So, I've compiled a set of instructions, and put a link at the top
of the page.  If you need any editing questions answered, or of you just want to 
hang out and type at some fellow editors, give us a visit.

Some Site Updates
</strong><small>- Brian</small></span></font>
<blockquote>
<font color="white" size="2"><font face="verdana"><span style="font-family: verdana">
I was looking around the site, and found some things that needed to be worked on.
The Links section has been updated, there is a new screen for contacting the webmasters,
the Site Map has been updated, and as I mentioned above, I added those Chat Instructions.
Oh, and now there is an Archived News link.  All the old news isn't up yet, but we have it
saved, and are working on getting it there.
There are still a few tutorials lying around that haven't been posted, but we are working
as hard as we can to get them there.

I was making my rounds when I noticed that there was an update on the

update includes information on completion status, new force powers,
level screenshots, and skin screenshots. If you weren't excited about this

Unethical Editing Practices
</strong><small>- Brian</small></span></font>
<blockquote>
<font color="white" size="2"><font face="verdana"><span style="font-family: verdana">
I read over on <a href="http://www.jedinights.com/wjg">WJG</a> That
Red, of the <a href="http://www.jedinights.com/skinners/">Skinners</a>,
has found out that JKMAG has been using his skins without his permission.
Looks as if it states in his readme's that his skins are NOT to be used
without permission.  I have to say that this is disappointing.  I'd think
that people are ethical enough to not use people's work without
permission, but I guess not.
<br><br>
PLEASE, if you are going to use other people's work in your mods, give
them credit, but most importantly, ask for permission.

Alexei Novikov .plan Update on Jed 0.8
</strong><small>- Brian</small></span></font>
<blockquote>
<font color="white" size="2"><font face="verdana"><span style="font-family: verdana">
Once again Alexei Novikov of the <a href="http://www.darkjedi.com">
Code Alliance</a> has updated his .plan with some great info on Jed.
<blockquote><font color="silver">
JED testing coming along. Not many bugs so far. Contrary to what it might seem, it's a bad thing... That just
 means the bugs are good at hiding. 
<br><br>
Anyway, I'll do it the same way as with JED 0.5. After JED 0.8 (that's what it'll be) is released, in a week
 or two I'll release another version fixing whatever bugs found by everyone using it during that time. 
That's be 0.81 or something. 
<br><br>
That brings me to the old topic - reporting bugs. When you report bugs, remember this - I can never fix 
bugs that I can't reproduce. To be able to reproduce a bug, I must be able to repeat what you were doing. 
So, when you encounter a bug, please try to find a case where you can reliably reproduce the problem. Describe
what you've done as precisely as you can. Check if it happens on every level or just one specific level. Etc, etc. 
Most important - after you've posted the bug report, answer the questions I might ask. This way there's a much 
better chance taht I'll find and fix the bug.
