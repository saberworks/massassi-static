Well, I just sent out a slew of emails to every person who has a level in my inbox.. The reason for the delay in a lot of level posting is pretty simple - We're swamped! I just posted 8 levels, and have 19 left in my inbox, all from the past 8 or 9 days. To help explain the situation - In the time that it took me to post these 8 levels, I received 2 more! It's great to see so much interest in JK editing, but it's also overwhelming.. Anyways, I'm gonna try to post 8 levels a day (The number of emails that appear in my client's window before I have to scroll) until I'm all caught up.. So hold tight, and check your inbox to see if we got your level.

Thought I would let a day go by w/out updating, eh?  Fear not.  Yesterday (or the day before, it's hard to tell, working night shift) I finished the final part of the review site scripts.  I've also been doing some work on another MP level... I just got that editing itch that pops up every now and again.<br><br>
This time, the level consists of two large buildings on stilts.  There are numerous catwalks that go around the outsides, as well as through the insides.  I'm trying to get that wide open city feel, similar to the building top level found in the Unreal Tournament demo (I can't remember the name).<br><br>
No estimate when it will be done, but hopefully in a reasonable amount of time.  <i>"When it's done."</i>

Well, since we're a new review site with quite a few reviewers, we're bound to go through some growing pains.  The ones I'm talking about now happen to be about the scoring system.  Since the reviews are by different authors, levels that are of a certain quality are being scored lower that some levels of a lower quality.  We are working to remedy this situation, and make the scores more consistent.  Please bear with us!<br><br>
Due to this, I have changed the score I gave <a href="http://www.massassi.net/reviews/jkmp/2.shtml" target="_top">Nomad's Land</a>, so check it out.  A few other reviews will be changed in the near future to more mesh with the others.  Questions? Comments? Put it on the Review Board.

As always, <a href="http://www.fcoutpost.com/" target="_top">The Force Commander Outpost</a> is pumping out the FC news.  Since the game has been showing up in stores, they've got a bunch of reviews listed.  You should also check the forums for some good FC discussion.<br><br>
Speaking of FC - I picked up my copy Tuesday night.  I only played through the 3 desert training missions, but I had a blast.  I'm not generally a strategy game fan, but since it was Star Wars, I just had to check it out.  It's slow-paced (compared to the games I'm used to), but it's just so cool to command Storm Troopers and AT-STs!

Wow, there was a <i>ton</i> of news posted yesterday.  As you may be able to tell, I hooked all the new reviewers up with the info they need to post reviews.  Hopefully we can keep something of this up through the long haul, eh?  Anyway, big thanks to all the reviewers for their hard work.
<br><br>
While I'm on the topic of reviews, two of them had a couple of errors that have now been fixed.  The screenshots on <a href="http://www.massassi.net/reviews/jkmp/4.shtml" target="_top">Temple of the Forgotten God</a> were messed up, and the scores didn't show properly on <a href="http://www.massassi.net/reviews/jkmods/10.shtml" target="_top">War Machine</a>.  Due to the fact that there were certain aspects of the review script that I couldn't test thoroughly, there are bound to be a few errors yet that haven't popped up.  If you run into one, just email me and I'll fix it!

Hey there people, I'm not dead!  I've just been extremely busy with school and work lately.  I got a computer networking job at Washington State University that's been taking up alot of my time.  I also have a girlfriend, and she tends to keep me away from the computer.  But, I managed to finally complete this level.  Anyways, here's the level description.
<BR>
<blockquote><font color="gray">This level is a medium sized saber level set on the water planet of Mon Calamari.  It should be good for 2 to 4 players.  It's geared towards no force saber battles, but it should work just fine for full force as well.  <a href="mailto:takimoto@massassi.net">Email me</a> if you find any glaring bugs or errors.  Overall, it should be a very high quality level.  You can download it here - <a href="http://www.swfiles.net/files/jk_and_mots/levels/motsmp/calamari.zip">Calamari.zip</a> (429kb).</font></blockquote>

<font color="gray">Necropolis is an Egyptian themed level, with quite a big download because 
almost 100% custom textures have been used to achieve the Egyptian feel. It 
was made with NF in mind, and may be a bit 'cramped' for FF. Some 'eye' 
switches need to be shot to activate them, and there is a hidden tomb (ohh, 
ahh etc). Now with added Scum!</font>

Well, Force Commander has shipped, and people are getting it all over the country.  I'm going to pick up my copy this evening, and hopefully get an hour or two of play time.  Anyway, as always, <a href="http://www.fcoutpost.com/" target="_top">Force Commander Outpost</a> has the goods.

Since our server seems to be purring like a kitten, I'm going to give the forum subdomain one more try.  If it doesn't work this time, I'll just leave it at that.  I have activated <a href="http://forums.massassi.net/" target="_top">http://forums.massassi.net</a>, but before I move everything over, I want to make sure everyone can access it.  So, if you please, try to access the above subdomain, and make sure it goes to the correct place (the forums!).  If you can't get to it, please email me!  I will not move everything over until I know nobody is having problems.  Note: cookies may or may not work as of yet on the subdomain, that will be fixed if I move everything over.

Obsidian made another <a href="http://205.229.72.73/html/Forum1/HTML/004225.html" target="_top">post</a> on the forums concerning a bug in the JKRPG version released earlier this morning. Here's what he had to say for himself:
<blockquote><font color = "gray">
There was a perticularly nasty bug that got through, allowing clients access to the adjoin reset item. I'm trying to
fix this as soon as possible. Once it is fixed i'll reupload the jkrpgfinal.zip and hopefully everything will work out
smoothly.
</font></blockquote>
And then later...
<blockquote><font color = "gray">
OK, its fixed and uploading as a I speak. There are two flavors of it, one that includes the level, tutorial, and fixed
patch commander gob (for those who haven't d/led the buggy version already), and for those who have, a nice
small 116k zip that includes only the fixed patch commander gob (rpgcode.gob).<br>
<br>
The links are:<br>
<br>
Complete JKRPG final zip: <a href="http://www.jedilegacy.net/hov/jkrpg/jkrpgfinal.zip">http://www.jedilegacy.net/hov/jkrpg/jkrpgfinal.zip</a><br>

</font></blockquote>
So the way I see it, if you didn't download the update that Brian posted about this morning, grab the first file. And if you <b>did</b> download the new one this morning, grab the second file. Happy JKRPG'ing all.

I was checking out the <a href="http://www.swvault.com/" target = "_top">SW Vault</a> just a few minutes ago and I noticed that John Smedley, Verant Interactive's President and CEO, sent a letter to the folks there in a vain attempt to dispell a few rumors that have been floating around:
<blockquote><font color = "gray">
Hello All,<br>
<br>
We're really excited about doing Star Wars Online with LucasArts and Sony Online Entertainment. It's going
to be a while before we release any official information, but I wanted to make a couple of comments. <br>
<br>
First of all, nothing related to the amount of game content we will have in the game is remotely final, so
things like the number of planets aren't going to be really announced for a while. I will say that we
understand clearly the extremely high expectations of Star Wars fans everywhere. I would just urge
everyone to wait a while until we are prepared to release more information.<br>
<br>
Second, don't read anything into words like "zones". We've been working onsome truly awesome
next-generation technology here at Verant, so terms like "zones" will really end up meaning vastly different
things then they have in EverQuest. <br>
<br>
Overall we're going to be keeping our heads down and working hard. From time to time we'll be stopping by
here and the other fans sites as they emerge and we'll say what we can, when we can.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
<br>
John Smedley<br>
President and CEO<br>
Verant Interactive, Inc.<br>
</font></blockquote>
For those of you who hadn't heard, there were rumors floating around that only 2 planets, for a total of 100 "zones," would be included in the game. If you don't know what a "zone" is, then... er... I'm not about to explain it.<br><br>
Thanks to <a href="http://www.swvault.com/" target = "_top">SW Vault</a> for letting me steal their news. Again.

<blockquote><font color="gray">
Well, I figured I'd get this out now.  It's as good a time as any other.  This is a skin pack of, oh, I don't know, let's just say fifty multiplayer skins for Jedi Knight.  They're all zany in their own way and should be downloaded.  Please.  Anyway, I'd like to thank the contributors for making this what it is and Zuljin for making this swank installer.  You guys rock, y'here?  So, I'll step out of this short-lived limelight and disapear.  I won't be doing any more public JK stuff in the future, so I guess this is it.  Later.</font></blockquote>
Everybody, download this skin pack.  It just rocks.  We'll get a more official page up soon, but for now, use the above download link.  As for Mehab4, he will be missed... We'll figure out what's going to happen to the IS site later on.

Well, I got a ton of excellent applications.  I should be announcing our new reviewers tomorrow morning.  After that, you can expect at least a couple a day until we get all the levels reviewed.  As I mentioned before, we will be working backwards through the archives, but we will review newer levels as they come in.<br><br>
I fixed the ratings link off the main review page, thanks to everyone that reported it.  Since I just posted the second review, I noticed that the "recent reviews" list isn't ordering them properly.  I will change the code, but the page won't be changed until we get another review posted.

Saw this over at <a href="http://www.outpostd34.com/" target="_top">Outpost D-34</a>.  <a href="http://www.graphtallica.com/" target="_top">Graphtallica</a>, a texture site that's been mentioned here more than once, has opened up a new section called the <a href="http://www.graphtallica.com/texturebank/" target="_top">Texture Bank</a>.  The Texture Bank is an area that allows anyone to submit textures to them.  I for one think this is an excellent idea, and I urge texture artists to support them by submitting textures.  I also urge level authors to use this new resource to get new and interesting textures for you levels.
