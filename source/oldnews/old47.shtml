They've got a sweet looking mod for JK called Smorph. Here's a quick description:

When you use this mod, you will be able to morph and fly either the crow or a tie bomber. Thats right, you can now BECOME a ship!

For those of you who don't know, <a href="http://www.outpostd34.com/abjedi/" target="_top">Absolute Jedi</a> every two weeks changes their Featured Level, and when the level is featured, a page is devoted to that level with pictures, and an interview with the author. As always, the level gets a score. In this case the RvI Early Preview got a 46.5 out of a scale from -50 to 50!

<A HREF="mailto:orionn@md.freei.net">Mike Starr</A> sent this update on the project:<blockquote><font color="gray">With only two short weeks to go, the Jedi Knight Screensaver Project is drawing to a close.  We have a pretty good variety of pics for the program, but we can always use more.  Folks, there's no such thing as a bad pic.  Give it a shot and send it in!
<BR><BR>
In case you haven't seen the previous posts, this is a project to make a screensaver from screenshots taken in Jedi Knight and Mysteries of the Sith.  I accept any and all pics from the basic stock levels up to completely user-made environments.  PCX files are fine, JPG/JPEG and BMP files are preferred and putting it all in a ZIP file would be nice.  And, by all means, multiple submissions are fine.
<BR><BR>
While you're at it, try your skill as a MIDI composer and make a Star Wars medley to go along with the project.  I will take the best written MIDI with the longest run time and/or themes incorporated.  Act now, before the competition heats up!
<BR><BR>
Try your hand as a Jedi-photographer and/or Star Wars musician!  Send your submissions to <A HREF="mailto:JKScreensaver@hotmail.com">JKScreensaver@hotmail.com</A>!
<BR><BR>
On a side note, I do not have the e-mail address for the artist named JK[Meteor].  The address will be needed later, so please contact me at <A HREF="mailto:orionn@md.freei.net">orionn@md.freei.net</A> as soon as possible.</font></blockquote>

I know, there have been a lot of "status" posts lately, but we'll get back on the news in a couple of days (if not sooner).  Anyway, I just finished deleting all the users on the forums who haven't ever posted a message.  If you had registered, but didn't get a chance to post yet, please re-register!  We had about 300 registrations get deleted.  For the actual move, I'm going to take care of it Sunday night, which seems to be the time when the least people are visiting.

I just discovered <a href="http://198.92.131.6/html/Forum4/HTML/000482.html" target="_top">this thread</a> on the Cog forum.  It's amazing, [JK]Meteor has written a brand-new AI bot cog.  He has a demo level you can download and play for MotS and he's working on a JK version.  It's really amazing what the bot can do, he can chase you, search for you, pick up items, determine the best weapon, lay mines, etc.  This is really amazing.  I highly recommend you check it out!  <a href="http://198.92.131.6/html/Forum4/HTML/000482.html" target="_top">The thread again</a>

I got notice today that UGO will be hosting our forums.  This *should* mean that they'll speed up quite a bit, as well as taking a huge processor load off our current server.  I have to call and get the information this morning, and hopefully I will have the forums moved over within 2 days.  This means some downtime (probably a couple of hours while the files move over), but all users and old messages should stay intact.  I will post a message on the main page here when I start moving the forums, as well as one when the move is finished.

I've just finished 3 days in a row of 12 hour shifts (6PM - 6AM) - add to that driving/eating/sleeping time and I haven't had any time left at all to work on the site.  Today was the last day, so things should get back to normal for me in about 12 hours (when I rest up and do some cleaning).  I haven't had time at all to respond to any email, so if you've written me recently, I will get back to you soon!  I hope to get all the MPG passwords out (I think there were 3) this morning, but then I'm hitting the bed...
<br><br>
I did, however, get a chance to talk to our hosting company about our subdomain problems and server overload.  They offered to put us on a better server - an offer we will be taking advantage of.  Hopefully the problems will clear up as that happens.  I hope that the move will go smoother than the last one.  No timeline on this yet, but when I get more info, I'll be sure to post it here.<br><br>
Finally, be sure to check out one of my other projects, <a href="http://www.wattosjunkyard.com/" target="_top">Watto's Junkyard</a>.  Kiramin has been working like mad to get the artwork section up to par (he's almost done!).  He's posted a new poll asking "Who is your favorite 'Bad Guy?'"  Please support us and vote for the Sarlacc!  He's also posted a few new pieces of artwork (click image to visit Watto's and get the larger version).
