             Just here to say that a little beta testing session of levels 2 and 3 has just taken place. I have to say Level 3: Prevention, is by far the most fun I've EVER had with JediBall. All I can say is, "damn.." , my fellow beta tester states, and I quote, "THIS RULES!!!". Whoa. Well After a little tweaking, I should have levels 2 and 3 completely done. Aw man I'm getting excited! JediBall 2 should be out soon. Be prepared.</font></blockquote>
             Can't wait to get my computer running (it came today, btw, just can't get the cdrom to work right yet) so I can finally try out this mod.  Thanks <a href="http://207.153.50.235/jk/" target="_top">Outpost D-34</a> for that news.

They also have a poll up on whether they should keep the look of the site, or go with a new one.  Personally, I think these sites should stop doing site re-designs and keep working on CONTENT.

                JailBreak for JK?

                <dd><font color="white" size="2" face="verdana"><span style="font-family: verdana">
                I received an interesting email from <a href="mailto:rondu@cssweb.com">Ron Dunlevy</a> this morning.  Apparently, he got a version of JailBreak working for JK a LONG time ago.  He hasn't released it due to the fact that the levels he has really suck (apparently).  If you are interested in helping this guy out (with the levels), keep reading:
                <blockquote><font color="gray">
                 I have a version of JailBreak that I have made called
                Detention Center. The game play is solid, but it hasn't been thoroughly internet tested (it has been heavily LAN tested), and I have two levels for it, and while architecturally they are cool, texturally they suck. (Sorry I am a programmer, I do NOT have an artists eye) I'd like to release it since it seems the team that is working on the "official" JailBreak will never release theirs. I have had this mod done since the first week in April, and did not release it then because of an agreement I had with Osan'gar.
                <br><br>
                So, this is what I want.... I want to release this mod, but I want someone to clean up these levels I have done. BTW, I have never played JailBreak for
                QUAKE, so this is based on my own ideas on JailBreak, plus feedback from my LAN testers.
                </font></blockquote>
                So if you're interested, drop this guy a line.  He has two email addresses, so either use the link at the top, or cut/paste one of these:  [rondu@cssweb.com] -
                [rondu@shepherdcolor.com].

Fellow CTFers told me they would like to see a level with totally different skins, for 1) Telling the teams apart easier, and 2) a new look. Well I decided I should be the one to do it with my WATERSLIDE level. So I am re-releasing WaterSlide CTF under the new name "WATERSLIDE SPECIAL EDITION." This version includes two totally new skins I have made. They include Batman and Spiderman. For people who havent seen the original level, it is a level based at a Water Park with 4 long waterslides that take you around the level. Its also a Capture the Flag level for those CTF Experts.</font>

It also changes the default blade to a slightly darker blue than usual, instead of green. See exarsaber.txt for more infomation.</font>

                                                 Ever wanted to add stuff to existing character 3do's?  This tutorial shows you the steps you can take to add a pony-tail to an existing model, but of course, you can use this technique to add other things (shoulder pads, capes, etc) if you feel inclined to do so.

                                                   (a.k.a. objectives) for Single Player levels. You create your goals 
                                                   using Goal! then you simply hit a key and Goal! will do all the "hard 
                                                   work" (and time consuming work) like writing the cog, writing the 
                                                   cogstrings and install the cog in Jed, when Goal! has finished it´s work 
                                                   your are ready to gob and test your level.

                                                        Remember the Warped Worlds weapons mod that was recently released?  Well here is a message I got from the creator of that:

The scheduled date of release is <b>this Saturday</b>, so get your modems warmed up for the download.  Here is the info from their news page:

All that's left now is the red tape of making it available for download. I received my "test run" first copy just before midnight Wednesday night directly from Azlon himself. I gave it a quick run through & my comments are detailed in the post below. All that remains for us is to get a download page up & running and get the thing uploaded to the server. If I am unable to reach our webmaster (Chyren) in time to send the upload copy we may not be able to make our deadline for Saturday, but that seems highly unlikely. Barring some unforeseen disaster (computer crashes, the end of civilization as we know it, etc.) It'll be ready to download Saturday evening at the latest!</font><br><BR>
                                                           Here is the detailed info Zues posted on the JKMAG news page.  Very cool stuff.
                                                           <blockquote><font color="gray">
                                                           First of all I can say beyond a shadow of a doubt that this is the finest Total conversion for MotS (or JK for that matter) I have ever seen. It is a tremendous leap beyond Manowar 2 in the respect that Azlon & co. took a real professional approach to this the latest incarnation of their Manowar series. When you first run the thing you almost swear to yourself that this is something Lucasarts would have released! I literally had to stop & remember that this was done by a handful of skilled individuals, who were simply editing MotS in their spare time! The setup backgrounds are EXCELLENT! There's one background pic of Boba Fett you just have to see to believe. Install was a snap too, Azlon's documentation is very well done & way easier to follow that his somewhat garbled text from Manowar 2. 
                                                           <br><BR>
                                                           The TC comes with 4 levels all designed by Kurt Schulenburg. It is one level that shines the brightest of the bunch as far as gameplay goes. The .goo file is named "Gravity" but it is listed as something like "Mandalorians in Space" in the in-game play list & this level plays like Escherworld on acid! You can leap & soar due to a lack of gravity, BUT like real space leaping too high will propel you into space! A Jet pack & Grapple hook are essential to avoid becoming space fodder for your enemies. One of my personal favorite aspects of this level is a large round asteroid that is suspended in space. because of the bizarre gravity, you can literally run around the asteroid (top & bottom) like a fly on an orange! This is just pure fun, believe me! 
                                                           <br><br>
                                                           I briefly looked at a few of the other levels, but wasn't able to delve too deeply into them because of time constraints. However, I did try out all the new gadgets & the Spycam is by far the best of the bunch. Using it is like using a wicked version of Force seeing. It really adds to the gameplay. I also tried out the new class system & was pleased with the way Azlon Balanced things out with weapons & gadgetry load out for each one. Heh, and yes, the new Jedi Luke skin is all that & more! 
                                                           <br><BR>
                                                           Well that's just a brief overview of the thing. I'll be playing it again tomorrow, right now its almost 2 am & I'm ready to sleep! Once I've played it some more I'll add to this. Till then check out our screenshots page via the link in the blue bar on the left side of this page. Until next time, May the Force be with you!

Actually, this level was made for nf battles. There are some traps, force fields, explosive fuel etc. in this level. Weapons: 2 concussion rifles and 2 or 3 rail guns (I can't remember), of course you will find all other (useless) weapons, too. There is no supershield or power boost. Have fun, and don't fall.

Anyway, watch the news for the upcoming release of Manowar 3.

                                                                         - When you preview a multiple MAT in Resource Picker, a scrollbar will now appear that will let you scroll through all cells in the file.<br>

                                                                         - When you change a template in Template Creator all the things that use it are now updated.<br>
                                                                         - Fixed a bug causing plug-ins written in Delphi 3.0 cause access violation on exit from JED.<br>
                                                                         - The plugin interface unit is now the same for Delphi 2.0 and 3.0</font></blockquote>

  target=_top>Saberworks</A> has just posted a poll asking your opinion on their 
  new MP mod. If you guys haven't played it yet, I suggest you download the beta 
  from the saberworks site. Basically, you have teams, and 3 lives. Once you 
  lose your lives, you get trapped in an area where you can watch the battle. 
  The last person standing wins (rather, his/her team wins) and everyone starts 
  over, choosing new teams if they want. It's very simple, but it makes for some 
  intense action. Anyway, Saberworks wants to know what you think of the waiting 
  period after you lose your 3 lives. Try the mod out, then <A 
  href="http://saberworks.jedinights.com/poll.htm" target=_top>let them know 
  what you think</A>. </SPAN></FONT></DD></DL>

  know this is not specifically JK related, but it does concern those of us 
  working on projects that may violate licence agreements of certain games. This 
  has been an issue for mots-to-jk conversions, etc. Anyway, the <A 
  href="http://www.darkjedi.com/" target=_top>Code Alliance</A> has announced 
  that they will no longer be working their XvT programs or documents. 
  Furthermore, they will take all existing material off their site. They ask 
  that people who have copies of it on their hard drives NOT distribute it over 
  the internet. Here is the full text: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT color=gray>I`m sorry to say but i have sad news for the 
    XWvT Fans. From this day on Code Alliance as the whole will no longer be 
    engaging in the development of XWing vs TieFighter ,Balance of Power , Xwing 
    Collectors Series,applications/research that would need access/modify or add 
    to the original game files. Thus this means the cancellation of ACE , 
    ACE_DXF opt utilities. Also we will be removing within the week from our 
    site any links to material that could be construed as violating the license 
    aggreements for the above games. <BR><BR>This is strickly a voluntarly move 
    on our part, afer a careful review of the license`s and other factors,it is 
    our opinion that we in fact were not abiding by the license`s. The Code 
    Alliance has always tried to remain within the law in our efforts to bring 
    fans editors and utilites. In the license`s for the above games there exists 
    a possibility for the Code Alliance or it`s members to be legaly liable 
    should we continue in our current efforts. <BR><BR>The Code Alliance will 
    continue to develop applications for games that we perceive would not 
    violate any license aggreements. <BR><BR>We would ask all WebMasters to 
    remove from their sites any links to the following documents or files 
    produced by the Code Alliance or it`s members, ACT Unofficial Specs, OPT 
    Unofficial Specs, OPT_Explorer.zip (all versions) , OPT Alternative File 
    Reading Process, OPTUtils. <BR><BR>As for files on personal computers , we 
    cannot dictate to you what to do with those ,We will ask you to Not openly 
    distribute them any more. <BR><BR>Code Alliance members may decide on their 
    own to continue with XWvT developments /research on a private basis ,that 
    will be up to the individual. <BR><BR>Thankyou for your understanding and 
    cooperation. <BR><BR>StealthJedi </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE></SPAN></FONT></DD></DL>
