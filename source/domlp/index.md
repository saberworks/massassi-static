### Foreword

Although the Death of Massassi has been greatly exaggerated, [this level
contest](https://forums.massassi.net/vb3/showthread.php?67495-Massassi-Level-Pack-The-Epilogue)
has resulted in some of the best fan-created levels ever. I would like
to thank CoolMatty for his stewardship of the site over the years and
for creating the contest that helped spawn these levels. I think I can
speak for everyone here at Massassi when I say thanks for all your hard
work and dedication to this site and the community.
