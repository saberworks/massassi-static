<dd><font color="white" size="2" face="verdana"><span style="font-family: verdana">
This may be old news, but earlier this week <a href="http://www.darkjedi.com/" target="_top">The Code Alliance</a> posted a new plugin for JED called PathFinder, created by <A href="mailto:b0ssk@iwc.net">BigBosskMan</a>. Their write-up says it best:
<blockquote><font color="gray">PathFinder is a plugin which allows you to quickly and easily create complex movement paths for actors in JK/MotS. For example, you have a city level, and to enhance the level, you would add civilians walking around, or in an Imperial Base, have troopers patrolling the perimeter. PathFinder does all the hard work for you, including creating new cogs. Lots of options too. Tutorial included.</font></blockquote>
You can download the plugin at their JediKnight/Plugins page.

<blockquote><font color="gray">
Hello,   This is Prince_Yackman     I would like to announce the releasing
of the Prince TC around Thanksgiving. It is going to be better than Spork. 
In it is a poison gun, saber to a sword, thermal detonators are an axe, and
there are much more things.  It is much like the MidEvil mod because the
same maker made it.. Or at least most of it . I am adding the extra great
touches...  and It is a lot nicer and smoother and not as.. messed up.</font></blockquote>

I haven't played it yet, so I can't say whether it's better than Spork. I'm assuming this is a clan associated mod. I just hope it's not related to the artist Prince! Well, he didn't really give me any links or anything, so I'm assuming he'll let us know when it's available for download. Then we can all party like it's 1999 (pun intended).

Not JK, but this is another Star Wars game I've been looking forward to.  If you don't know, Force Commander is a 3d real time strategy game following the original trilogy of movies.  There is a killer <a href="http://www.checkout.com/games/nn/article/0,6712,1743351,00.html" target="_top">interview with Garry Gaber</a>, project leader, over at CheckOut.com.  Here's a snip.
<blockquote><font color="gray">
I know there are two campaigns on offer, one for the Rebel Alliance and another for the Empire. Will there be some kind of random map generator or are you sticking solely with the campaign?<br><br>
<i>Neither. We're providing players with an opportunity to engage in skirmish mode, meaning they'll compete against up to three computer players. They'll be able to pick from any of the single player scenarios in addition to several specific multiplayer arenas.</i>

It's with great frustration that I put another one of these messages up.  We've been having some "behind-the-scenes" server problems lately, and they've been taking most of my energy to take care of.  This is the reason why I haven't gotten back to all of you who sent in staff applications.  Rest assured, when all of these things get taken care of, I will contact all of you with my decision (which isn't made yet).  Thanks for being patient.

<font color="gray">This is a medium size multiplayer level set on an asteroid in space. It consists of 5 major fighting areas that are all connected in one way or another. The actual temple was designed for guns and sabers. I tried to make it scary at first but as I worked, I decided to make it more comical.  There are several switches for dettraps and turrettrap cogs. There are also secret walls and elevators that go to good sniper points. I made an attempt at the eerie NOT the sacreligious.
I hope that it works.  I spent about six months on it.  </font>

<font color="gray">You and many others have been snatched from your homeworld. Taken under power to compete in the Emperor's newest blood sport... Re-Bound.
Armed with only a super modified blaster and grapping hook, your lightsaber and your wits you must survive or die for the pleasure of millions of observers - You have no choice so ready yourself, the Galaxy is watching... 
<br>
This conversion has been designed with tactics and team play in mind - therefore you will find that there is NO force to rely on - you will have to use your skills with the grappling hook and brains to out manouver your opponents, whilst all the time trying not to shoot yourself with that rather powerfull weapon... after all the name of the game is Re-bound.
<br>
1 thing - follow the installation instructions included - you need to fool patch commander a little but it aint too cleaver so you wont find it hard - lol</font>

Gotta give our network site some exposure eh?  We have some juicy tidbits this morning... First of all, some killer console commands (secrets, cheats, whatever) - try "makemeapirate" for a killer surprise.  A full list can be found over at <a href="http://www.infernalmachine.net/" target="_top">Indy's Inferno</a>.  The other thing is a link to an interview with one of the games creators.  A lot of good info (and info on why they don't have MP).  Check Indy's Inferno for all the latest Indy Junk.

For those of you who are anticipating this game, the demo has been released (73.4MB).  You can get it from <a href="http://www.wheeloftime.com/">The Wheel of Time Website</a>. It's pretty cool. It's got some of the smoothest water effects I've ever seen. If you don't already know about this game, it's based on the Unreal engine and is pretty trippy. You play the part of a young wizard and can use various spells and weapons along your way. I'd say the gameplay is comparable to Thief, in that you don't want to try to run and gun your way through everything.

Not quite JK, but considering the amount of people on our boards who have played the demo, I think this info is pretty relevant. Seems that UGG_Boot, being the lazy guy that he is, has been slacking off on his Puppet Jedi development long enough to play the Indy demo, and even went so far as to spend his precious time writing a <a href="
http://www.darkjedi.com/~ugg/indywalk/" target="_top">walkthrough</a> for it. While I'm deeply dissapointed in UGG's lack of work ethic, I'm pretty impressed by the walkthrough - It's comprehensive and easy to read. So, if you're one of the idiots like me, who have been struggling with the demo, head over there..

Soy Farm was made to give a fair chance for all personalities in MotS and not to favor any certain personality. There are two versions of the level: one for Full Force and one for personalities. The two versions differ mostly in item placement: weapons, ammo, etc. Enjoy.</font>

This isn't Jedi Knight related, but no Quake2 playing Star Wars fan should be without this skin. It's so tight! Lord Maul's animations really capture the feel of the movie. I could go on and on, but I won't. Just go read about it at <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/q2pmp/">Quake2 PMP</a>.  It's in the model of the week section. Make sure to download the Lord Maul skin, and not the Darth Maul skin because they're made by different authors.

Hello y'all. Takimoto here. Brian was gracious enough to let me join the ranks of the few and the proud here at Massassi. I hope to continue the proud tradition of providing quality tutorials and Star Wars news. I'll do my best to bring you up to date news, as well as new editing techniques. Sorry to sound all sappy and stuff, but I'm getting a bit misty-eyed just thinking about all the good times that lay ahead.

Wow, while browsing the above mentioned site, I noticed that they had posted an <a href="http://www.womengamers.com/dw/maraint.html" target="_top">interview with Ryan Koffman</a>, "Senior Level Designer, co author of the Sith script, and contributing designer for Mysteries of the Sith."  Pretty good read, here's a quote:
<blockquote><font color="gray">
Mara Jade was actually not our first choice for Mysteries of the Sith (MOTS). One original design called for each mission being assigned to a different bounty hunter, with each successive mission tying into the one previous. When we decided that might be too disorienting for the player, we wanted to settle on one character. The problem with Kyle Katarn was that DF 2: Jedi Knight (JK) left him too powerful, in a way.

Meant to append this to my last post, but I forgot. Didn't feel like editing the news file (and don't have the password to access it anyways), so here we go..

<br><br>

Why oh why do people send in level descriptions with attrocious spelling and grammar? If you want to use 2nd grade english in your message board posts, fine - I'm not gonna beat a dead horse here.. But c'mon.. Have some pride in your work, pimp it to the best of your abilities. Make up a snazzy background story for the level, or at the very least use proper grammar when describing it. I wouldn't touch some of these levels with a 10 foot stick because of their descriptions.. If you can't take the time to describe your level nicely, what are the chances that you put a lot of work into the level itself?

<br><br>

If you wish to reply to this post, use <a href="http://198.92.131.6/html/Forum1/HTML/002022.html" target="_top">this thread</a> - I would personally love to get some insight from the other side - Reasons why people don't put any effort into these things, etc.. 

<br><br>

And one last thing.. Capitalize when you refer to yourself as "I"! You'd think some people have serious self esteem issues, not deserving of capitalization or something :)

For the 3 or 4 of you who noticed my absence, I've been away for a few days in Maryland for a wedding. 4 solid days of partying. I can't quite describe the family that my cousin married into, but I can give an example. At 2 in the morning in a private dining room at a hotel, one of the groom's brothers got up on a table, and one of the other brothers tried to pull the table cloth out from under him. It didn't work. These were grown men, and this little incident is really only the tip of the iceberg.. They were an exhausting group of people to hang out with (I dare you to name another family that dropped their pants at a wedding reception, wearing identical boxers, and danced to the song "Shout".), but they were hilarious.

<br><br>

I've posted 6 or 7 levels today, and have 7 more to post - I can't post them for now because of server troubles (I don't have the password needed to access the server where screenshots are uploaded - all 7 levels are ones with screenshots). I've got 3 3dos to post as well, and will get them later.

I know everyone is getting tired of seeing these posts, but I think it's good to let you know what's going on behind the scenes if it affects you.  Anyway, the domain transfer went through yesterday so within a couple of days you should be able to access the site by going to our domain, <a href="http://www.massassi.net/" target="_top">http://www.massassi.net/</a>.  There may be a bit of dropped email due to the nature of DNS.<br><br>

Other than that, you may have noticed a few service interruptions... our new server has got some quirks we're trying to work though.  Hopefully these will be fully resolved soon.  Big thanks to Kedri for hooking us up with a 15meg OS patch...

Yep, you read that right.  In case you haven't noticed, things have slowed down considerably over the past two weeks.  There are many, many reasons for this (and no, most of them aren't the usual "real life" excuses).  We've been having so many server problems you wouldn't believe.  We were basically kicked off our last server for using too much bandwidth (you people download a lot of levels!).  So, we were forced to move to this dedicated server, which seems a lot faster overall.<br><br>
Anyway, that's beside the point.  I'm looking for a few DEDICATED people to help us out with posting news, files, etc.  We are not interested in someone who can't update nearly every day.  We need people who can not only check their email box for news, but also scour all the other JK/Star Wars sites out there for news (on a daily basis).<br><br>
If you are going to apply, make sure you have excellent spelling and grammar skills.  You will also need some basic knowledge in HTML and FTP.  Note: We are <i>not</i> looking for web designers, we are looking for news and filemasters only.  You won't be redesigning any sites, so if that's your only interest, please do not apply (I only mention this because every time we put a "help wanted" call out there, I get a ton of people telling me how great they are at flash and javascript and how they have all these great ideas for turning Massassi into the next multi-media sensation).<br><br>
If you are ultra-interested in the JK community, really want to get involved, and are dedicated enough to stick around, please drop me an email: <a href="mailto:brian@massassi.net">brian@massassi.net</a>.  I <i>will</i> respond to each email, so if you do not get a response within one week, assume your mail didn't come through and send another one!  Since we are in the middle of the domain transfer, there will no doubt be some dropped email.

It also includes a corrected version of the GOZ blastech pistol, with better point of view and matting, and new sabers, made by Vega and myself. If anyone has Star Wars skins, send them my way and they will be included in BSWP 2. The blastech is only a new 3do to fit the star wars universe, nothing else has changed from the normal pistol.
