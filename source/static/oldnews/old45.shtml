Talk about a killer news day today!  First we get Ryan's KILLER sp level (trust me, I've been beta testing it for about a year now), and now something for the MP fanatics out there.  I am very pleased to announce the release of the Massassi Players Group (<a href="http://mpg.massassi.net/" target="_top">http://mpg.massassi.net</a>).  What is this thing you've been hearing so much about for the past few weeks?<br><br>
The Massassi Players Group is a place for JK and MotS players to get together and play MP games without visiting the Zone.  We have completely streamlined the registration process and made it easy for everyone to know exactly which mods to download.  This way, everyone has the same mods, and nobody is left downloading while everyone else is playing.  Just login, download the mods, and get playing!<br><br>
We support two types of games.  The first is a master ICQ list of everyone who wants to play. When you're ready to play a game, just send a message to the list announcing your game, and everyone has the option to join.  Secondly, we have our dynamic IP Board.  This IP Board allows you to go in, select the addons you are hosting, select the amount of time you estimate the game will be up, and post the game.  Anyone browsing for a game can visit the IP Board, get a list of addons that are activated in that game, and join.<br><br>
All it takes is a simple registration.  Details (as well as our privacy policy) can be found over on the <a href="http://mpg.massassi.net/" target="_top">MPG main page</a>.<br><br>
We have also just created a new forum (over on the <a href="http://198.92.131.6/" target="_top">Massassi Forum System</a> for MPG related discussion.  Please visit the site and let us know what you think!

It is truly an amazing testament to what editors can do with this game. My hat's off to Ryan, and I thank him for giving us such a brilliant and fun level.

<b>Description:</b>
<font color="gray">In the years following the Battle of Endor and the destruction of the Second Death Star, many systems throughout the galaxy began to break away from Imperial rule. Consequently, Imperial military garrisons were established on many Core and Rim worlds to maintain Imperial order. However, unrest is brewing beneath the tight grasp of Imperial power. Many Core systems have already proclaimed full support for the New Republic and the Empire is hard pressed to keep even insignificant Rim worlds under its command. Many garrisoned systems everywhere wish to declare neutrality, or even to join the strengthening New Republic, but will not for fear of retribution. The planet Derra IV is on the edge of uprising. If the System Command Center, the key to Imperial defense and planning, were to be neutralized, a small force of New Republic troops could sweep the disorganized Imperials and regain control of the planet. Intelligence has reported the site of this command and communication center to be inside the bulwark of Imperial defenses - the impenetrable Fortress of Derra IV. Your mission is simple. Breach Imperial security, neutralize defenses such as TIE Fighters and ground-based shields, and disable the communications network to prevent reinforcements from being summoned. After the path is clear for the incoming New Republic troop transports, get out before the Imperials know what hit them.</font>

I wanted to have the MPG released this morning, but I ran into a hitch with javascript (I know HTML, Perl, PHP, MySQL, some Pascal and some Delphi, and javascript was Greek to me!).  I did get it figured out, but it took me a lot longer than I expected.  I hope to finish programming the final tidbits this afternoon and release tomorrow.  Don't know what MPG is?

Whoops. This e-mail came in nearly two weeks ago and drifted out of my inbox and into oblivion. It almost happened again. Many thanks to Mike Starr for re-sending the info. Check it out:

<blockquote><font color="gray">
Ladies and gentlemen, the Jedi Knight Screensaver project is now active once again!  You can now send your entries to the e-mail address <a href="mailto:JKScreensaver@hotmail.com">JKScreensaver@hotmail.com</a>.<br>
<br>
Due to the delay, the deadline is now the end of February, and I will still accept post-deadline entries as long as they keep coming.  Don't forget to
include your name and any other info you want included with your pics, like "Stormtrooper Slaughter by Ninja Monkey".  Also, convert the file from PCX to BMP or JPG/JPEG if you can, if not I'll try to do it.<br>
<br>
A few tips for picture taking: turn off the crosshair and HUD, and cover up the "Screenshot Taken" words if you can.  They make for a more professional-looking pic.  Also, when you stand still the camera rotates around you. Experiment with it.  If you can, make it a group effort.  Get some friends together for some interesting multiplayer pics.  Finally, doctored pics are accepted and encouraged.  Jerec in a tutu?  Kell Dragons doing the macarena? Send it in!</font></blockquote>

I would like to wish everyone luck on the level contest!  Last time we ended up with a ton of great levels, and after seeing the stuff that's been released SINCE then, I have the feeling that this one will be a lot better.  I'm trying to get Kiramin to work on a level (he's the guy who did Wayrest Landing in the last pack), but he's busy with other stuff, so I don't know if it will happen.<br><br>
In other happenings, I have my system tuned and ready to go again.  I installed a new HD (my 8.4Gig filled up) and it pretty much went without a hitch.  I had an old PCI graphics card and an extra 15" monitor, so I gave Windows 98's Multi-Monitor support a try.  It's actually a very cool thing.  You can hook up two monitors to one computer, and it just extends your desktop.  It's now very easy for me to test out our pages in 800x600 and higher resolutions - I just open IE or Netscape on the smaller monitor.

There are internal defences and atmosphere fields in place, making a wrong
move a dangerous thing.  This level is intended for 2-4 players.  Well
placed weapons and powerups make for fast play.  My first multiplayer level.</font>

The late, ill-fated contest has finally arrived.. We've been debating about whether or not it should be CTF, and finally, we've decided on "No".. If you guys want a CTF contest, give us some emails, and if the response is strong enough, the next time we have a contest, it'll be CTF.. For now, grab your cleaving tools, and get to work on a JK death match map. Same rules as last time, so if you remember them - Great - If not, just wait and I'll dig up the rules and post them again.. Thanks for being patient guys.
