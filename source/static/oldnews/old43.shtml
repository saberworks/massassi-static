<b>Description:</b>
<font color="gray">Ladies and gentlemen, WELCOME to the BEST level I have EVER made. New sounds, NEW cogs, NEW 3dos, and a NEW look. The secret downstairs basement is where the real fun is.... too bad no one will
find it, since it's in SUCH an easy spot to locate, in the *hint* 'SABERS' arena room.  OOPS!! There are THREE (3) different arenas in
this level, all for seperate minds..... first, the MAIN (deathmatch) arena.  Next, comes the saber arena, and THEN there is the SNIPER arena.
There is also a fun room, bathrooms, bar, and a meeting hall (by bar, sort of a lounge).  Neither heavy nor light in weapons/items, very nicely
done, I thought.  Good for a little more than 8 players.  For saberists, and gunners.  NICE lighting, PLUS music in some rooms, with the great abundance of nice graphical stuff!!  My BEST work yet, and acclaimed GREAT by many people.  This is the NEW standard at which many levels should be made...for BOTH saberists, and gunners. Have fun everyone.</font>

<b>Description:</b>
<font color="gray">This is a multilevel outpost buried in the middle of nowhere. The level consists of basically five rooms and a series of tunnels connecting them. Sounds exciting, huh?  Well, I hope you'll find it more interesting once you are inside. Highlights, I suppose, would be the top room and the bottom room in terms of structure design, although I seemed to have pushed the envelope a bit much on the bottom room.  The framerate in the bottom room only can be a little slow, but nothing too serious. This level is designed for both saberists and gunners alike.  It is also an excellent level for MOW2. <b>Only one warning:</b> if you don't use Force then don't use this level. Force is an absolute <b>MUST</b> and that is <b>VERY</b> intentional. Happy hunting.</font>

Whoops. I found this at the bottom of the stack of mail. It has to do with the JK Screensaver <a href="mailto:orionn@md.freei.net">Mike Starr</a>'s working on (check out Friday's news):

<blockquote><font color="gray">
Like a mailoc in the shadows, Murphy's Law strikes when you least expect it. For some reason, my e-mail program is glitching up right now, and I can't
recieve any attached files.  I will do my best to meet the deadline, but for now just hold onto your JK and MotS pics.<br>
<br>
As long as I'm here, a few notes on submissions.  Make sure to include a name and any info to go with it, such as a title or clan affiliation (i.e.
Cyber Monkey of the Ewok Death Squad). Also, try to change the PCX file to a BMP or JPG/JPEG if possible.  I don't know how it will function with PCX files.  Next, please use the best resolution possible for your pics, just for overall quality.  Don't worry about it fitting, the screensaver will have a "fit to screen" feature. Finally, multiple pics from the same author
are fine, just keep it within reason.<br>
<br>I'll put up another post when everything is working again, so keep working
on those pics!</font></blockquote>

We have another Review at <a href="http://tosche.jedinights.com" target="_top">Tosche Station</a>.  It is of the JK MP saber level Tusken Proving Grounds.  It got a excellent rating of 93 and is worth checking out.  We have also passed our first 10,000 hits!  Most importantly we are starting to run short on levels to review again.  Authors please give your levels the advertisment they deserve and submit your work for us to review.

I have seen a couple of messages on this site and others that some people are having problems accessing the forums.  However, nobody has told me exactly what the problem is, so I can't even look into it!  The forums (http://forums.massassi.net) work fine for me, both at home at at work.  I know most people can get to them since the message posting is still going strong.  However, since a few of you are having problems, I want to fix the problem.  It seems to have started when we moved over to the subdomain (rather than the IP address). What I need is the following information (please email it to me: <a href="mailto:brian@massassi.net">brian@massassi.net</a>):<br><br>
<ul><font face="verdana, arial" size="2" color="gray">
<li>The address in your URL bar (cut and paste, please).
<li>The name of your ISP if it's a national one.
<li>The <i>exact</i> error message you are getting (<b>IE USERS:</b> Please go to Tools/Internet Options/Advanced and UNCHECK "Show friendly HTTP error messages" - This will ensure that you're actually seeing the error, rather than Microsoft's "friendly" version of it).
<li>Whether or not you can access the following URLS: <a href="http://forums.infernalmachine.net/">http://forums.infernalmachine.net</a> and <a href="http://depot.massassi.net/">http://depot.massassi.net</a>
<li>What browser and browser version you are using.
<li>What operating system you are using (Win95/98/NT/Etc).
</font></ul><br>
Responses to this (by those parties that are having problems) would be extremely helpful in figuring out what the problem is.

Chills I tells ya, I got chills.. Arby, over at <a href="http://www.jedilegacy.net" target="_top">Jedi Legacy</a> is thinking of starting up an E-Zine, similar to the last one he ran, <a href="http://www.jediknight.net/darkfall" target="_top">Darkness Falls</a>. An E-zine, if you haven't heard of it, is basically an online magazine, a monthly deal, packed with cool articles (Check my personal favorite, <a href="http://www.loonygames.com" target="_top">loonygames</a>).. He's looking for people who would like to see this come to fruition, and people who would like to help, so hop on over to JL and get the skinny..

Smacker FAQ

UGG_Boot, from over at <a href="http://www.darkjedi.com/" target="_top">The Code Alliance</a>, was kind enough to submit a tutorial/faq on Smacker.  If you don't know, Smacker is the video compression tool used to create the cutscenes in Jedi Knight (not MotS).  Anyway, <a href="http://www.massassi.net/tutorials/smacker/smacker.htm">take a look</a> at the FAQ.  While you're into the Smacker mood, best take a look at the <a href="http://www.jediknight.net/darkfall/jkarts/smacktut.html" target="_top">Smacker tutorial</a> that was posted a long time ago over at <a href="http://www.jediknight.net/darkfall/" target="_top">Darkness Falls</a>.

<a href="http://www.jedilegacy.net/" target="_top">Jedi Legacy</a> has the low-down on yet another departure from LEC.  Another high-profile one, at that.  As you (probably) already know, there was a mass-exodus from LEC after JK and MotS were released (some formed Nihilistic Software, some formed Infinite Machine).  Since then, there have been a few more... And now this.  As Speak says... "Hmmmm."  Who is it? Check Jedi Legacy!
