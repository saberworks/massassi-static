It's by <a href="mailto:topace@flash.net">Element_Greven</a>. You can find the tutorial on their main news page.
             <br><br>
             Also, the Workshop is a site that will create cogs for you, so if you need a cog programmed, and don't have the time/motivation to learn the language yourself, check these guys out.

             I've gotten a lot of requests for a cog tutorial... but unfortunately I don't know cog, so I can't write one.  Check out our tutorials section for cog-related stuff, then check out the Workshop cog tutorial (posted above), then, check out <a href="http://www.jediknight.net/darkfall/" target="_top">Darkness Falls</a>.  If you're new around here, you probably haven't heard of 'em.  Darkness Falls was an online Star Wars Gaming type magazine.  It used to come out about once a month, and had a bunch of awesome content.  I hear from RBF (editor) that they're working on a new issue, but having some problems getting the articles done.  We'll have to wait and see.  Anyway, in their September '98 issue, they posted a <a href="http://www.jediknight.net/darkfall/dfsept98/cogframe.html" target="_top">Cog Tutorial</a> by <a href="mailto:pele975@hotmail.com">Mark 'Pele' Jones</a>, of the Warzone series.  If you want to learn cog, please go read that tutorial.

                  <font color="gray">This is a simple cube shaped level. It has a COG running so that if you 'activate' a console, the Particle stream in the middle of the room advances
                  through the 32 MotS particle systems, one for each activation.  The script also prints the template name (for later reference if you see one you like). In addition there are 3 spawn points, each pointed in a different direction(Up down and sideways) to demonstrate the effects of "gravity" and "direction" on the particles. I made this level so I could see what the different particle systems looked like, and I thought other MotS editors would benefit from it.

                      <b>Description:</b>
                      <font color="gray">Basic JailBreak rules: Two teams, two jails. When you die (by any means) you are placed in the other teams jail. When you enter jail, a 45 second timer kicks off. If no one else is killed in 45 seconds, you are executed and returned to the game. If someone else on your team is killed, the timer stops until they enter the jail (respawn), and then the timer resets. During your stay in jail a check is performed every 5 seconds
                      to see who is in jail. One point is awarded to the capturing team for every person in jail.
                      When all of one team is captured, a 10 second "breather" timer is kicked off, and then the
                      whole team is executed. Suicides in jail will not free you from jail, but being killed by
                      someone on the other team while in jail will free you. Prisoners cannot use force powers, but are given their force powers back after escaping. The team member who closes the jail for his/her team will receive a point for everyone captured while the jail is closed. On the other side, they will receive a point for everyone who escapes when he opens the other teams' jail. The jail forcefields take 5 seconds to recharge after being ppen/closed, and will automatically turn on after being off for 30 seconds.
                      <br><br>
                      Here is a scoring recap:
                      <ul>
                      <li>capture = 1 team point / 1 point for the teammate who closed the jail
                      <li>escape = 1 team point / 1 point for the teammate who opened the jail
                      <li>kill = 1 team point for killing team
                      <li>suicide = 0 points
                      <li>prisoner check = 1 point for every prisoner
                      <li>execution = 3 points for every executed prisoner
                      <li>full team bonus = 10 points

                       <b>Description:</b>
                       <font color="gray">Four team multiplayer mod. The arena is divided into squares. You capture a square for your team by jumping on it. The square cannot be retaken for 5 seconds, and the squares cannot be claimed by other teammate until it has been changed to a different color first. When all squares are captured by one team, that team scores bonus points.
                       <br><br>
                       Scoring is as follows:
                       <ul>
                       <li>Capture Square = 2 team/player point
                       <li>Lose Square = -1 player points
                       <li>hold square = 1 team/player point
                       <li>All squares = 10 team points
                       <li>Kill = 1 player point
                       <li>Suicide = 0 points
                       </ul>
                       To get "hold" points, no one else must capture that square for 30 seconds. You get "hold" points
                       for every 30 seconds you keep the square.</font>

                              Not much news flowing this weekend, but I found an interesting article. Hopefully a treat for us late-nighters (hey, I rarely do an update after 6pm).  It's focused on Half-Life maps, but it surely applies to Jedi Knight/Sith as well.  <a href="http://hla.halflifehq.com/levelgameplay.html" target="_top">Gameplay Issues for Map Design</a> is an article that discusses some very important features that all great DM levels should have.  This is a very good article, so check it out if you're interested.

                                 An interesting article I found while clicking around on the internet.  <a href="http://www.bluesnews.com/" target="_top">Bluesnews.com</a> posts an article entitled <a href="http://www.bluesnews.com/articles/latency_vs_ping.html" target="_top">Latency vs. Ping</a>.  Great info for online gamers.  The gist of it is like this: You can get better performance of online games if your computer isn't storing network responses in a queue to be processed.  Your computer does that if your game is running at a low framerate -- often the computer is so taxed that it has trouble keeping up with everything.  If you are getting bad framerates in JK, try turning your resolution down till they clear up, this will make a significant difference in most systems.

I will post a url of a preview as soon as I get the okay from Rieekan.      <li>Yesterday was a good day.

It is made for use in the creation of single player levels. It has a bank machine(a consolse where you withdraw credits from) and deposit (a consolse where you dump all the credits you have on you into your bank account), in it you talk to people by activating them, for instance there is a payer who will ask you to assainate someone, once you assasinate them (listed as deadman in the cog) you return to payer and activate him again and he will pay you the blood money. Also there is a setup for a store with a storekeeper who will welcome you if you have money or not (if you activate him) and consoles which you activate to get items if you have enough money. (real items are suppose to be displayed in a glass case benind the console and you activate the console to get that type of item) For now this is only for one level, that is I mean it won't carry the money amount to the next level yet. This and other options will be added in the next version. </font></blockquote>                            The original cog is by Matthew Pate, Merlin finished it up and such..
