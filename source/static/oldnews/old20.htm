                Microsoft's driving game, Midtown Madness, was another show-stealer.  It's not really a racing game in that the mode we played actually let you drive around an entire city.  There's no place you can't go -- it's a free-for-all with no concequences (in that paticular mode, other modes discussed below).  You get to choose from a ton of cars (and other vehicles like a city bus and a semi-truck).  They had everything set up with their force-feedback steering wheels and pedals.  The booth was crowded the whole time (what else can you expect with a kick-arse arcade that's free!?).<br><BR>
                The other modes (which weren't being shown) include a regular race mode and a capture-the-flag type mode kindof like Cops and Robbers.<BR><BR>

                 Here are the answers to the questions posted on the message board:
                 <blockquote><font color="gray">
                 <i>Will a level editor be released with the game?</i><br>
                 Yes.  Nihilistic programmed their own engine, but actually licensed id software's level editor, QERadiant, but modified it for Vampire. They will release their version of QERadiant with the game.<br><BR>
                 <i>If I were planning on editing levels for Vampire, what level editor should I be learning now to give me practice?</i><br>
                 QERadiant.<br><br>
                 <i>How are models for the game created? With 3D Studio Max?</i><br>
                 Models can be created with 3D Studio Max, as well as other modeling programs, but a converter is used to change them into a format that can be used by Vampire.  No word yet on whether their converter will be released with the game, but we will ask.<br><BR>
                 <i>How long does it take to BSP (or otherwise compile an average sized level)?</i><br>
                 Probably about as long as a similar sized Quake/Quake2 level, but no official word.  We will ask on this as well.<br><BR>
                 <i>What is the air speed of a ladened swallow?</i><Br>
                 I don't know the exact speed, but the environment created in Vampire is so detailed that you can actually watch the damn swallows flying around the city.<br><br>
                 <i>What is the average level size (as compared to a JK level)?</I><br>
                 The levels in Vampire aren't quite like other games.  You switch areas kind of like in Half-Life, but they are actually at logical places (rather than in the middle of a hallway, you enter a building or leave a town).  The game seems very NON-linear, so you can backtrack into areas that you've already left. Ray Gresko let on that there will be over 100 different area's in the game.  They aren't as long as JK levels but they are way more involved, and there are more of them, so the game is ultra-long.

                 We have a ton more info to post, but we don't have the time at E<sup>3</sup> to write it all up.  We will give a full report when we get back to our own computers.  However, we can still get questions answered, so be sure to leave them on the message board.

                 We tried a couple of times to get into the Lucasarts booth, but they brushed us off.  After that, we talked to some people that know the LEC folks.  They said LEC wasn't showing the new game nor anything else new.  That said, we actually had the opportunity to try to get into LEC, but we turned down the opportunity due to all the kick-arse stuff going on at other booths.
                 <br><BR>
                 It was actually very difficult to understand LEC's position on things.  Every other game developer had their programmers, level designers, etc, out on the floor talking to everyone.  LEC, however, was locked up in the back corner of the show (actually, a different building than all the other PC developers) behind doors with a big, black "by appointment only" sign.
                 <BR><BR>
                 Pod Racer was being shown at the Nintendo booth (and according to LEC, Don "Aristotle" Crew was down there [which turned out to be a BS answer to get us to leave them alone]).  It looked pretty cool, nothing really special though.  It is sure to catch a lot of market due to the new movies, but there's nothing new or revolutionary about it.<br><br>
                 We couldn't find a booth showing off The Phantom Menace, so we really don't have anything to report on it.

                   Okay people, old boy Captain Ramen, Alexei Novikov, Mangore Kiramin and myself are having a killer time here at E3.  The absolute best thing we've seen so far is Vampire, The Masquerade.  I had a chance to have a couple of conversations with Ray Gresko and Yves Borkmans regarding their new game, the development of Jedi Knight/Sith, and other things.  I actually got hooked up with the Vampire Role-Playing book.  That said, I am looking for questions that you guys would like to have me ask them.  If you have any questions you would like asked, leave them on the discussion board.

                   As I said above, Vampire is the absolute best game we've seen so far.  The environments and architecture are incredible.  Also as I mentioned above, I had a chance to talk to Ray Gresko.  We asked him about everything we could think of.  Here is some of what we know so far.  The editor they use, and are going to release with the game, is QERadiant, the level editor id software used for quake 1 and 2.  So, if you want to get started with Vampire editing, you can download it and give it a try.  The editor works the same, even though they are using a completely new engine.
                   <BR><BR>
                   Some of the things that stand out are the architecture, the amazing lighting (dynamic shadows on all the characters and models), and the amazing level of detail (LOD) system.  Basically, a model's polygon/face count goes down as you get farther away from them, which frees up system resources for the things that are closer.
                   <BR><BR>
                   He also talked about bump-mapping a lot of their textures to increase the detail.  Stuff like wood carved arches over doorways and the actual doors themselves will actually look 3d (rather than just a texture painted on them).
                   <BR><BR>
                   The game is very story-oriented, even more than JK.  It has an incredible amount of recorded conversations, as well as a complete hour of new music.  The story is based around different clans of vampires.  To stay alive, you must drink blood.  You can actually lure peasants and other people into alleyways so the guards can't see you.  You can't, however, drink all their blood, or your humanity will drop below an acceptable level.

                         Usually I leave the news gathering to rest of the guys, but I just couldn't pass up posting this little nugget I found on <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/" target="_top">GameSpot</a> about Obi-Wan, the next game following the DF/JK tradition. Here's what they had to say:
                         
                         <blockquote><font color="gray">You play a young Obi-Wan Kenobi in this game, and presumably you will learn force powers and lightsaber techniques as you travel to various locales in the Episode I universe. Some of the environments we saw were a desert world that reminded us of Tatooine, as well as the populated world of Coruscant, and the palace in Naboo.<br><br>
                         
                         The game uses a new 3D engine, although the early footage looks only marginally better than Jedi Knight's graphics. Motion capturing is being used for Obi-Wan's extensive moves, which include several twisting backflips and different lightsaber attacks. The only enemies we saw in the video of the game were various droids, including the long-snouted STAP droids and transforming battle droids from the trailer.
                         </font></blockquote>
                         
                         Obi-Wan is slated for a late fall/early winter release.

                          I apologize for my lack of updates today (thanks to everyone who has updated, though).  I've been getting ready for <a href="http://www.e3expo.com/" target="_top">E3</a>.  It's about 6:30 PM Pacific, off to pick up master-editor Mangore Kiramin for the show.  Expect full reports which will be announced here.  On another note, my trip to Mississippi has been cancelled (that's a good thing).  Off to L.A.

I spent a great deal of time practicing my "rock" technique to ensure a convincing environment. A little large for a one-on-one.  All the weapons are there, except the conc, and I used a cog to move the other heavy stuff around, making it difficult to get to. Go frag a friend.</font>

Here is the post of the levels section of PC Gamer online:

                                       You've been asking for this area for a long time, and it's finally here: Levels for one of the most popular games of all time, Jedi Knight. Either Jeff Walters or Brian Lozier reviewed each of the levels; both Brian and Jeff have been involved with the Jedi Knight community for a long while, so if they say a level rocks, you know it rocks.

                                       Yes, I started this date a little bit early, but I had to fire it off before I went to work (midshift = 11pm - 7am). In other news: E3 plans are going well, Captain Ramen from the Outpost, Mangore Kiramin formerly of Saberworks, old friend of mine named Rob, Alexei Novikov, and Aristotle of JediKnight.net will all be attending.  Expect full reports -- after that though, I leave on another trip to Mississippi - only for a week or so, I'm sure the other news people can stay on top of everything.<br><br>
                                       I also wanted to give a shout out to Kedri, the little-known Massassi staff member.  He posts most of the levels we get here, but since we don't have specific logins for our levels script yet, he doesn't get his name posted.
