<blockquote><font color=aqua><i>Well, the guys over at the <a href="http://www.jedinights.com/massassi/">Massassi Temple</a> have asked me to write some hints for editing. Now, it's gotten pretty easy to find information on how to build levels but I'm constantly finding better ways to go about doing things. Now most of my hints, as you will find, fall under two categories, those that I find are helpful while building, and those that help the levels overall look and play. I hope that some of these little tips will help you build better levels.</i></font>

This document is another great read for all you level editors out there.

<a href="thrust_calc.zip">Thrust Calculator</a>

automatically round for you.  If you have no idea what I'm talking about,
download it and then visit the 
<a href="thrust/tutor.htm" target="frame2">Sector Thrust</a> tutorial.<BR><BR>
Another thing on this note... the JK sites have been flooded with these
vector calculators... and they have helped the JK community a bunch.  However,
I will not post any more unless they offer a significant advantage over those
already out there.  JED is projected to be able to accept plugins in the 
next release, how about an addon to JED that allows you to put in two things,
and it calculates right in JED?  Just a suggestion - thanks for all the help guys.

would still suggest you go through the <a href="thrust/tutor.htm" target="frame2">
Vectors and Sector Thrust Tutorial</a> so you know what's going on.  You might
need a .dll called <b>vb40032.dll</b>.  If you don't have it, it is available

In our <A HREF="tutors.htm" target="frame2">tutorials</A> page, you will find detailed illustrated tutorials on many aspects of JED and editing
techniques in general.  We have attempted to make every tutorial easy to understand, but if you have
problems, I would suggest reading it a few times over, and practicing.  If that still doesn't help, 
go over to www.darkjedi.com and try out their message boards, as there is always someone there who
can help.<BR><BR>
If you surf on into our Projects page, you will see all the projects we have planned for the future, as 
well as all the ones we have so far completed.  If you have anything you would like added to this list, 
feel free to <A HREF="mailto:lozier@bigfoot.com">email me</A>, and if it's valid, I'll do everything I can to either create it or have it created
for me.<BR><BR>
You'll also notice that some pages are completely lacking in content, such as the files page, but that will
all come in time, and when pages get populated, I will add it to the news.  The point of releasing a site
that's not finished, you ask?  Well we decided that it was pointless to hold off.  There are a number of great
tutorials here, as well as good general editing information.  Also, this site will always be growing, and 
will not be "finished" until there is nobody else involved with editing Jedi Knight.
