JkEdit Version 1.03
</strong><small>- Brian</small></span></font>
<blockquote>
<font color="white"><font face="Arial"><span style="font-family: Arial">
The <a href="http://www2.netropolis.net/theforce/">JkEdit Homepage</a> has
once again updated JkEdit.  Here is the lowdown on the new version:
<blockquote><font color="silver">
Version 1.03 of JkEdit has some new features:
<ul type="square">
<li>A sector can now be Deleted
<li>Surfaces and Objects can now be Cut, Copied or Pasted 
</ul>
Version 1.03 of JkEdit has a few bug fixes:
<ul type="square">
<li>A crash could occur after splitting a surface
<li>A crash could occur after deletion of certain surfaces
</font></blockquote>
I can't wait to try this version.  Now that sector deletion is added, complex
architecture can be created.  Look for an update to the beams tutorial within
a few days.

your team to blow up 3 key points on the opposing teams Base.<br><br>
The lineup in this new group is amazing too.  A lot of old Dark Forces editors,
along with Pele, who is a member of <a href="http://www.darkjedi.com">The Code

Alexei Novikov .plan Update
</strong><small>- Brian</small></span></font>
<blockquote>
<font color="white"><font face="Arial"><span style="font-family: Arial">
Alexei Novikov, from <a href="http://www.darkjedi.com">Darkjedi.com</a>
has updated his plan with his thoughts on the new level editor.  Here it
is for your reading pleasure:
<blockquote><font color="silver" size="-1">
<P><FONT COLOR="#808080">June 12, 1998 21:05</FONT><BR>       Heh, I see JED isn't lonely again. JkEdit is now here to keep company. I can only salute that.   Well, I only heard some unpleasant things about Ole Thomasen. I don't know him myself, so I can't comment. <P>Just download the editor and check it out. And pay $25 if you like it. I downloaded it, but haven't been able to check it out so far - it won't find JK or MOTS on my HD because I run it on NT and I installed them on Win95 (Neither JK, not MOTS runs on NT, unfortunately).<P>       Regardless, that doesn't affect JED plans in any way. I will continue developing it, I will neither rush, nor delay JED on account of JkEdit. I'm sure I'll be getting requests to do something "like in JkEdit". That's OK - I'll do it whereever possible. But don't ask me to redo JED interface from scratch.<P>         In other news - I got an ABit Pentium II 440LX motherboard and an ATX case today. Just a little more stuff to add and I can test MP things at home. I have some plans for that.<P>        Also, I finally went out and got Unreal (happend to pass by Best Buy on some other business). Now I'm playing it. Well, the performance in terrible on my P133 w/ Voodoo Rush, even in 512x384, as I expected. About 15fps and below. But I'm quite tolerant to such things - back in Doom days when we played 4 player DeathMatches, I didn't mind to take the 386DX40 machine and even kicked the butts of some guys who played on P90. Well, what can I add to my E3 Unreal experience so far? It looks great, but true to its name - unreal. Almost all the time I find myself guessing what this or that effect in the levels is supposed to mean. The game itself is pretty chaotic. No clues, no nothing. Just kick butt and run until suddenly you get level loading screen. I'll probably be alone in saying that, but I think the level design is uninteresting. Although there're many cool details here and there, the things doesn't make sense as a whole. I mean - first level is a spaceship? Really? Doesn't look that way to me. Parts of it look like they belong in a ship, but where's the logics in their connection? And these large fans you pass through. Ahem... They're supposed to move large amount of air from where to where? Ventilation? I thought I passed the ventilation shaft in totally different place.  Why the ship design is totally linear? Etc, etc. <P>            Anyway, the engine is really cool and AI is definitely improved - those bastards find you much quicker than in any game I played. That only makes them easier to kill so far though :-). There's a great editing potential in this game. Interesting things should pop up. Maybe even JK->Unreal conversion? It's be cool for your lightsaber to give off colored glowing.<P>An update:<P>          I checked out JkEdit. Interesting concept. Admirable integration. Sure looks cool, but I have yet to see how functional it is - his editing tools are incomplete to say the least. I still think that outside view is preferable for building initial architecture.

<font color="white"><font face="Arial"><span style="font-family: Arial">
You can read yesterday's news to find out about the new JK/MotS editor.  I
have messed with it for a few hours, and decided to write a quick tutorial
on some of JkEdit's basic functions.  Some of the features are very handy,
while others seem cumbersome compared to Jed.  Most likely this is just because
JkEdit is a completely different editor, so I will probably get used to the
differences.<br><br>
The tutorial is titled <a href="jkedit/tutor.htm">Getting Started With JkEdit</a>.
It addresses how to add objects, plus some basic architecture tecniques.  It is
by no means a complicated tutorial.  As the title implies, it is for beginners.

Just like that saying goes "90% of the program take 90% of time, the remaining 10% take another 90% of time". Yep, that's precisely what's happening. Finishing things up takes a lot of time.

Anyway, I'm getting close to stating beta-testing (which is usually about 2 weeks from the release), maybe a week from now? That's about 3 weeks from now estimated.
<br><br>
Oh, BTW, which remind me - there have been quite a few suggestions on the JED board lately. Some of them suggest things that are already done though :-). Anyway - what I'd like to say - keep 'em coming. When I react with critique that doesn't mean your suggestion is dumb (well, maybe sometimes). Rather it needs to be refined.
