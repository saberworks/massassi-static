<font color="white" size="2"><font face="verdana" size="2"><span style="font-family: verdana">
As mentioned above, we have a tutorial on interpreting and modifying player actions in MotS.
What does that mean?
<blockquote><font color="silver">
In MotS, any COG can analyze, define, disable, enable or otherwise manipulate the messages that are sent by the user, from peripherals like the keyboard and mouse, to the game.  For example, a cog that is set up this way can determine when the player is moving, firing, when an item is used, when the camera mode is switched - even when the autosave function is used, and disable these messages or modify their outcome.

I have created a page dedicated to you guys.  This is the deal, The Massassi Temple will now start


covering editing group news.  This DOES NOT mean we'll post every little thing, but when you post new


screenshots, make a significant addition to your site, or other major type updates, we will report it.


<br><br>


Why?  Well I don't think the editing groups get enough coverage.  What do you have to do?  First off,


visit out <a href="editgrps.htm" target="frame2">Editing Groups</a> page.  Once there, make sure your group


is listed.  If it's NOT, please <a href="mailto:lozier@bigfoot.com">email</a> me with the url of the page.


Next, submit a paragraph long description of your editing group.  This can be changed once per month by emailing


me.<br><br>


Finally, when you update, send me an email and I will get the news up as soon as possible.  When you submit news,


please make the email as brief as possible, while still being brief.  Please provide FULL urls to each thing


you are submitting, along with the full url of your page, EVERY time.  This will help me in making prompt updates.

Well, I know I was quitting, but after things hadn't been updated in 11 days, I didn't want to see


the site die.  So yeah, after my 11 day break, I guess I'm back.  Hedge has been busy (I guess), Evan is in


FIJI (lucky fool), and I don't have a clue where Overkill is.  If they want, they can still help out (I know Evan will,


but Hedge is busy with other projects).

Now for the reason I started this post -- I have fixed the tutorials section, which has moved all of our tutorials


over to the ftp server, and also added all the missing tutorials.  We now have a grand total of 33 tutorials


in that section!  Another *should* be added tonight, on skinning -- it is a great tutorial, so keep your eyes


open for it.  Expect more updates from me!


<br><br>


Oh, yeah, I'm also going to do another edition of my curving pipes tutorial -- old boy Jon Clark and my bud


Pot-Head showed me a cool way to get more rounded curves -- it's a bit less exact, but it looks rad in the end :-)
