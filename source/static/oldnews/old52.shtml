I think we need to get a SW Online site up soon... The information keeps pouring in! Check out this interesting tid-bit I snagged from <a href="http://www.usatoday.com" target = "_top">USAtoday</a>:
<blockquote><font color = "gray">
In this case, the fantasy world starts with Luke Skywalker's home planet of
Tatooine, about the same time the original film began. "The Empire is in
control of the universe at that time," says Dan Connors, a LucasArts game
creator. <br>
<br>
Players won't be able to choose already-established characters such as
Luke Skywalker, Han Solo or Princess Leia. Instead, they can choose from
roles such as rebel soldier, bounty hunter and mercenary. Characters can
travel throughout the planet to the spaceport of Mos Eisley and other cities.
Bounty hunters might scour the cantinas for wanted criminals, and rebel
soldiers might be sent off-planet. <br>
<br>
Developers plan to have other planets to travel to when the game launches,
and environments can be added over time. "The scope of the game is going
to be huge," says Haden Blackman, a LucasArts content specialist. "We are
looking to have two planets with each having 50 adventure zones. Each of
those zones in and of itself is massive and populated by characters and
creatures."<br>
<br>
During the action, the characters created by players will encounter
computer-controlled non-player characters and some familiar ones from the
Star Wars movies, books and games. "You'll definitely run into familiar
(names)," Blackman says.<br>
<br>
LucasArts chose not to allow players to choose the roles of Han, Luke,
Leia and other familiar Star Wars denizens, he says. "That preserves the
quality of the character already known in the Star Wars universe. Still, you
might run into Boba Fett."

The levels have already gone through individual beta testing the entire time we've been judging them, but the final pack just needs a little quicky beta to make sure I didn't break anything gobbing it all together.

You can bet we'll kick up a site on this game as time goes on (it's still two years away), but until then, we'll be posting news regarding the SW Online RPG game here on the news page.  That said, here goes...<br><br>
Saw over at <a href="http://www.ve3d.net/" target="_top">Voodoo Extreme</a> that USA Today <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/life/cyber/tech/review/games/cgg155.htm" target="_top">posted an article</a> on Lucasarts/Verants upcoming online RPG.<br><br>
GameFan also posted a piece.  This time it's an <a href="http://www.gamefan.com/hotinfo.asp?s=5774&rs=" target="_top">editorial</a> discussing the possibilities of this amazing title.  Here's a small clip.
<blockquote><font color="gray">
Imagine the possibilities…
<br><br>
You race in a modified corvette loaded with contraband through an asteroid belt on a spice run from Kessel. The Imperials are hot on your tail, and jettisoning your illicit cargo’s looking like a really good idea before the Imps board the ship. The only problem, is that what you’re carrying is worth the price of a small planet, and your employers wouldn’t be too forgiving should it fall into the wrong hands... As your turbo-lasers bounce harmlessly off the hull of the massive Star Destroyer, the grip of a tractor beam embraces the sleek smuggling ship, now helpless in its grasp.

So how do you get your level/mod reviewed?  All it takes is submitting it to the Massassi Temple, and it will automatically be considered for review.  We will start with the latest levels, and work our way back as time goes on.  Please be patient, as we have well over 600 files to review!

So close it's not even funny.  I am almost done with the review site.  I hope to have it finished by Saturday morning.  This does not mean it will be released to the public (although if you're clever enough, you can easily get a preview) on that day, since I still have to get a staff of reviewers.  I intended to put out the call this morning, but I got caught up in the programming, and didn't get a chance to write up the criteria.  Hopefully that will happen this weekend as well.

The sacred day has finally come. Check out the press release I snagged from <a href="http://www.lucasarts.com/" target="_top">www.lucasarts.com</a>:
<blockquote><font color = gray>
SAN RAFAEL, Calif. -- March 16, 2000 -- LucasArts Entertainment
Company LLC announced today it will partner with Verant Interactive Inc. and
Sony Online Entertainment to create the first massively multiplayer Star Wars
online role-playing game. Expected to release in 2001, the title will immerse
thousands of game players into the classic Star Wars universe. Gameplay will
feature a unique combination of combat, specialized missions, and daring
quests.<br>
<br>
The Star Wars online game will be developed by Verant, distributed and sold
at retail by LucasArts, and available for play exclusively online at The
Station@sony.com (www.station.sony.com).<br>
<br>
The partnership brings together three of the foremost companies in the
interactive entertainment industry. LucasArts, a leading international developer
and publisher of interactive entertainment software, has developed critically
acclaimed and commercially successful Star Wars titles across a variety of
platforms since 1991. Verant, creator of EverQuest, the most successful
massively multiplayer online game to date, is recognized as the leading creator
of persistent gaming universes. EverQuest currently boasts more than 200,000
customers, 120,000 of whom play daily. Sony Online Entertainment produces
and distributes online games and gameshows targeted to mainstream consumers
and game enthusiasts, including EverQuest.<br>
<br>
"The combined expertise of LucasArts, Verant, and Sony Online Entertainment
will bring to gameplayers an incredibly dynamic online gaming experience
worthy of Star Wars," says Simon Jeffery, president of LucasArts. "The
immensity and richness of the Star Wars universe lends itself ideally to a game
of this nature."<br>
<br>
"We couldn’t possibly ask for a better universe in which to create a massively
multiplayer game, " says John Smedley, president and CEO of Verant. "Star
Wars offers such an incredible amount of depth and detail that we’ll be able to
create a place for fans to feel right at home. This game is going to be
incredible!"<br>
<br>
"Star Wars online will be a phenomenon that transforms online gaming for both
gamers and casual game players," says Lisa Simpson, president of Sony Online
Entertainment. "It is a great addition to the blue chip brands our audience has
come to enjoy at The Station. We are delighted to work with LucasArts and
continue our close association with Verant Interactive."

Okay, maybe it's the NyQuil finally kicking in, but I must say this has got to be one of the best times for Jedi Knight. The JKrpg was recently released, and in record time, a milestone in editing in my humble opinion. We're currently chin-deep in the most kick-arse levels for JK, a truly excellent bi-product of the Massassi Level Contest.
<br><br>
Then there's the soon-to-be-released Massassi Level Pack #2, representing the pinnacle of level-editing achievement to date. The Massassi Players Group is picking up its second wind, and with a solid base of well-known players that's only growing. To cap it off, newcomers arrive to the site and sign up on the forums by the handful everyday, the surest sign that JK (or Massassi) ain't goin' anywhere anytime soon!

I finally got the time to make it happen.  The scripts are about 75% done, and I hope to have it completed by tomorrow morning.  I will make an announcement later on today or early tomorrow asking for reviewers (please don't email me yet, I'm working on a format to submit a sample review).  I'm very excited about this, I hope you are too.

Wow, a bunch of news this morning!  Anyway, our hosted site, <a href="http://www.darkjedi.com/" target="_top">The Code Alliance</a>, has just released a new program called CAGE (Code Alliance Game Explorer).  It is a container manager similar to Conman or JKGob, but handles tons of different file formats (from games such as Half-Life, Quake, Heretic, Hexen, Dark Forces, Jedi Knight, Outlaws, Descent, and Freespace).  It also converts a bunch of image formats to BMP.  Head on over to get the goods...<br><br>
In other CA news, they are moving to a new domain: <a href="http://www.code-alliance.com/" target="_top">http://www.code-alliance.com</a>.  The site should be active (if your DNS has updated yet), but not all of the pages are working... Give it a couple of days before you switch your bookmarks...

MPG Site Updates
</strong><small>- <a href="mailto:brian@massassi.net">Brian</a></small></span></font></dt>

<dd><font color="white" size="2" face="verdana"><span style="font-family: verdana">
In preparation for the release of the 2nd Massassi Level Pack, as well as the re-birth of the <a href="http://www.massassi.net/mpg/" target="_top">Massassi Players Group</a>, I have been working on the site.  No new levels or mods yet, but I have added some features that people have suggested.  First off, you can now get a list of members sorted by the date they joined, rather than alphabetically by nickname.  There is a link to this off the main members listing.<br><br>
You can also now <b>delete</b> yourself from the MPG.  This is only if you want to permanently un-register from the MPG!  All you have to do is log-in, and there is a checkbox there to delete yourself.  Any more suggestions (other than more frequent updates, which we're working on), please <a href="mailto:brian@massassi.net">email me</a>.

<dd><font color="white" size="2" face="verdana"><span style="font-family: verdana">
I'm sure everyone noticed the fact that MPG hasn't been updated in a while.  I don't really know the reason for this, other than the fact that my weekly updater never updated.  Anyway, In preperation for the imminent release of the 2nd Massassi Level Pack, I'm looking for someone to webmaster the site for us.  Here are the qualifications:<br><br>
<ul><font face="verdana, arial" size="2">
<li>Must know basic HTML
<li>Must be an active member of the JK community.  This means that you play all/most of the levels that get released, are up to date on community happenings, etc.
<li>Must be able to update the site at least twice a week.  This means adding killer mods/levels to the site as needed.
</font></ul><br>
Basically, the whole site is scripted.  This means that you do not have to know much html, other than what you need to update the news (link code, bold, underline, etc).  There are no pages that need to be updated manually, so all work you do will be through web-based scripts.<br><br>
If you think you are up to it, send me an email.  Your first task is to get the email right.  In the subject line, please put <b>MPG Staff Application</b>.  If it's not there, your email will be lost (gotta love automatic filters!).  Mail all apps to me at: <a href="mailto:brian@massassi.net">brian@massassi.net</a>.

As mentioned above, we're doing some work on MPG.  One of the things I'll be doing is purging members that registered, but never completed the registration.  This will be done at or around midnight tonight.  So, if you registered, got your password, and never logged in, you will be deleted.  Also if you registered and never got your password, this applies to you.  You can either <a href="mailto:brian@massassi.net">email me</a> and ask for it, or let yourself get deleted and re-register.
