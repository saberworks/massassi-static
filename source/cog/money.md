    Money Cog Description
</p>

It was designed in Mots, but it
sould work in JK, I don't know for sure I have not tested it in JK. It
is made for use in the creation of single player levels. It has a bank
machine(a consolse where you withdraw credits from) and deposit (a
consolse where you dump all the credits you have on you into your bank
account), in it you talk to people by activating them, for instance
there is a payer who will ask you to assainate someone, once you
assasinate them (listed as deadman in the cog) you return to payer and
activate him again and he will pay you the blood money. Also there is a
setup for a store with a storekeeper who will welcome you if you have
money or not (if you activate him) and consoles which you activate to
get items if you have enough money. (real items are suppose to be
displayed in a glass case benind the console and you activate the
console to get that type of item) For now this is only for one level,
that is I mean it won't carry the money amount to the next level yet.
This and other options will be added in the next version.
