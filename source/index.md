## The Massassi Temple - Open Source

We are in the process of converting all the old files/tutorials/etc. to an open 
license.  If you would like to help, please view the forum thread:

<https://forums.massassi.net/vb3/showthread.php?68160-Future-of-Massassi-(open-content-open-source)>

And the github repo that powers this site:

<https://github.com/saberworks/massassi.net>

Note that there are many broken links here but we are working on it.  
Eventually this will replace the real Massassi Temple.

In order to help, you should probably learn about:

* html
* css
* markdown
* git/github
