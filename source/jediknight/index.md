## Introduction

(All this was written in the late 90s so please read with a grain of 
salt.)

In our opinion, Jedi Knight is the best Action
game ever released for the PC. It has everything from an engaging
storyline and a great story to great graphics and such special
features as the lightsaber and force powers.

True, as of this writing (August 1999), the JK
engine is showing dated graphics. The graphics quality doesn't
compare to newer releases such as Unreal and Half-Life. However,
Jedi Knight's appeal isn't in the graphics - it's in the theme. For
a very long time, people have wanted a game in which they can
actually use a lightsaber to defeat their enemies. As mentioned
before, the addition of force powers also brings a whole new
dimension to the game.

Add to that some of the best level design in
the history of action games, easy to use multi-player support, a
high quality engine (to date, there has only been one patch
released, and all it is for is to fix a small joystick bug), and a
whole slew of user-created maps and mods, and you have a very
addictive game with a ton of replay value.

## Demo

[Lucasarts](https://www.lucasarts.com/) released a demo of the game just before 
it was released in stores. You may be able to find it online somewhere.  Better 
yet, buy the full game on Steam or GOG for cheap.  The demo is basically Level 
9 of the game, a very impressive level showing off the depth of gameplay and
the high-quality level design that the game consists of.

## Addon Levels

Addon levels can be created by users for Jedi
Knight (read below). These levels can be downloaded from this site
(see our [download section](/levels/) in the nav bar). Once you have
a level you want to play, you will have to unzip it with something like
[WinZip](https://www.winzip.com/), and then install
and run it.  Most addons include instructions.

## Editing Information

Lucasarts created Jedi Knight in such a way as to allow users (like yourself)
to create their own levels, skins, and other types of modifications.

The Massassi Temple started out as an editing
site, dedicated to bringing the Jedi Knight community tutorials to
teach people how to make their own addons. From there, we decided
to give users a place to release their maps, but that's
[another story](/about/).  Anyway, if you would like to make
your own levels or mods, be sure to read over our [Basics](/basics/) section,
and then take a look at the [tutorials](/tutorials.html).

## Cheat codes

If you are having trouble with the game, or
just want to fool around, there are quite a few cheat codes that
you can use. All you do to use them is hit the 't' key, then type
the code, and press [Enter].

## Console Commands

Console commands are the commands you can type
directly to the JK engine. You already have experience using
console commands if you've ever used a cheat
code. If not, please read over the cheats section for a brief
overview.

Cheat codes are one type of console command, but there are many others that can 
help you out.  You can see the rest of the console commands in the [JK 
Specs](/jkspecs/).

## Command Line Switches

Command line switches allow you to turn on certain features of the game 
(advanced display options, etc) by typing it in at the dos prompt. Find the 
command line switches in the [JK Specs](/jkspecs/).
