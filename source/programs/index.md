**Update 2016:** If you can't find what you're looking for here, or if
there are broken links, try the [tools
section](http://jkhub.net/library/tools.php) of [JK
Hub](http://jkhub.net/).

Below you will find a fine selection of programs to help you edit
various aspects of Jedi Knight and Mysteries of the Sith. (NOTE: Almost
all of the utilities for JK files also work with MotS files, because
they share the same file formats).
