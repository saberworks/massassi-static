**Update 2016:** If you can't find what you're looking for here, or if
there are broken links, try the [tools
section](http://jkhub.net/library/tools.php) of [JK
Hub](http://jkhub.net/).

Below you will find a fine selection of programs to help you edit
various aspects of Jedi Knight and Mysteries of the Sith. (NOTE: Almost
all of the utilities for JK files also work with MotS files, because
they share the same file formats).

> have the required dll files. Green means you have them, red means you do not. 
> If anything OTHER THAN msvbvm50.dll and comcat.dll are RED, then you need to 
> download the following file. If only those are red (or if they are green), 
> you are ready to go! If files other than msvbvm50.dll and comcat.dll are red, 
> you need to download these [dll files](misc/classcreator_DLLs.zip).  Once 
> they are downloaded, run the setup.exe file contained in the zip, and it will
